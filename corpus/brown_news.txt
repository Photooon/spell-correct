<s> The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place . </s>
<s> The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . </s>
<s> The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr. . </s>
<s> `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city '' . </s>
<s> The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . </s>
<s> It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . </s>
<s> The grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' . </s>
<s> Merger proposed </s>
<s> However , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' . </s>
<s> The City Purchasing Department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '' . </s>
<s> It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem . </s>
<s> Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury . </s>
<s> It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected '' . </s>
<s> The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes . </s>
<s> `` This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program '' , the jury said , but the State Welfare Department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County , which receives none of this money . </s>
<s> The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds '' , the jurors said . </s>
<s> `` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden '' on Fulton taxpayers . </s>
<s> The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation . </s>
<s> Wards protected </s>
<s> The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand juries , the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee . </s>
<s> `` These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said . </s>
<s> Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '' . </s>
<s> The jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable '' . </s>
<s> Ask jail deputies </s>
<s> On other matters , the jury recommended that : ( 1 ) </s>
<s> Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and `` a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail '' . </s>
<s> ( 2 ) </s>
<s> Fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable '' pension plan for city employes . </s>

<s> Meanwhile , it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds . </s>
<s> The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act , and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled highways . </s>

<s> While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31 . </s>
<s> A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5 . </s>

<s> The new school superintendent is Harry Davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated Felix Bush , a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee . </s>

<s> The former county school superintendent , George P. Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board . </s>
<s> During the election campaign , both candidates , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone calls . </s>

<s> Austin , Texas </s>
<s> -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . </s>
<s> Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . </s>
<s> Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . </s>
<s> But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . </s>
<s> Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . </s>
<s> He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since Texas was a republic '' . </s>
<s> It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . </s>
<s> The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer . </s>
<s> The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . </s>
<s> Dewey Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . </s>
<s> `` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said . </s>
<s> `` You take out of circulation many millions of dollars '' . </s>
<s> Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies '' . </s>
<s> His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor B. Jones of Houston , J. B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin . </s>
<s> Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts . </s>
<s> He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday . </s>

<s> -- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties . </s>
<s> The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . </s>
<s> There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . </s>
<s> It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here . </s>
<s> Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El Paso would be $451,500 , which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate . </s>
<s> The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school . </s>
<s> Dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E. ( Red ) Berry and Joe Ratcliff . </s>
<s> While details are still to be worked out , Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected . </s>
<s> `` We're getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting '' , said Ratcliff . </s>
<s> `` But I believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it also . </s>
<s> I'm willing to stake my political career on it '' . </s>
<s> Rep. Berry , an ex-gambler from San Antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies . </s>
<s> A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding later . </s>
<s> The house passed finally , and sent to the Senate , a bill extending the State Health Department's authority to give planning assistance to cities . </s>
<s> The senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar . </s>
<s> One validated acts of school districts . </s>
<s> Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont Navigation District . </s>
<s> The third amended the enabling act for creation of the Lamar county Hospital District , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted . </s>
<s> Without dissent , senators passed a bill by Sen. A. R. Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district . </s>
<s> Money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site . </s>
<s> Two tax revision bills were passed . </s>
<s> One , by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba , would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized . </s>
<s> Instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $1,000 fine . </s>
<s> It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research League . </s>
<s> The other bill , by Sen. A. M. Aikin Jr. of Paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds . </s>

<s> -- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday . </s>
<s> Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise , a Wise County hamlet of 250 people . </s>
<s> When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas . </s>
<s> Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse . </s>
<s> The bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project . </s>
<s> Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas . </s>
<s> Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten's attack . </s>
<s> The bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas , Eligio ( Kika ) De La Garza of Mission , Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs . </s>
<s> `` This is a poor boy's bill '' , said Chapman . </s>

<s> `` Actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county , altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court '' , said Karns , who is a City judge in East St. Louis sitting in Cook County court . </s>

<s> Washington , Feb. 9 </s>
<s> -- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs . </s>
<s> The President , in a special message to Congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research . </s>
<s> The aged care plan , similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on Capitol hill . </s>
<s> It was defeated in Congress last year . </s>
<s> Cost up to $37 a year </s>
<s> It would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes . </s>
<s> The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4,800 of pay per year . </s>
<s> The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent -- 3.25 per cent each . </s>
<s> Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system . </s>
<s> The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs . </s>
<s> Outlays would increase </s>
<s> Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 . </s>
<s> Both figures would go higher in later years . </s>
<s> Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years . </s>
<s> These would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes . </s>
<s> Nursing home care </s>
<s> The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems : 1 </s>
<s> Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days . </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital . </s>
<s> A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a `` unit formula '' allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit . </s>
<s> 3 </s>
<s> Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient . </s>
<s> 4 </s>
<s> Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness . </s>
<s> The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged . </s>
<s> Calls proposal modest </s>
<s> He said his plan is designed to `` meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay '' . </s>
<s> `` This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs '' , he said , `` and with sufficient ' deductible ' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals . </s>
<s> `` This is not a program of socialized medicine . </s>
<s> It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed . </s>
<s> Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital '' . </s>
<s> Wouldn't pay doctors </s>
<s> The plan does not cover doctor bills . </s>
<s> They would still be paid by the patient . </s>
<s> Apart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools . </s>
<s> The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care . </s>
<s> Moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the schooling costs . </s>
<s> Contributions to schools </s>
<s> The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students . </s>
<s> The schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships , based on need , of up to $2,000 a year per student . </s>
<s> In addition , the government would pay a $1,000 `` cost of education '' grant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grants . </s>
<s> Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 . </s>
<s> The President recommended federal `` matching grants '' totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones . </s>
<s> More for nursing homes </s>
<s> In the area of `` community health services '' , the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction . </s>
<s> He asked for another 10 million dollar `` initial '' appropriation for `` stimulatory grants '' to states to improve nursing homes . </s>
<s> He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals . </s>
<s> In the child health field , the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau . </s>
<s> He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute . </s>
<s> Asks research funds </s>
<s> The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation . </s>
<s> He did not say by how much . </s>
<s> For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities . </s>
<s> The President said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine . </s>
<s> The President said his proposals combine the `` indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them '' . </s>
<s> Reaction as expected </s>
<s> Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines . </s>
<s> Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the President's plan . </s>
<s> Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message . </s>
<s> Senate Republican Leader Dirksen ( Ill. ) and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck ( Ind. ) said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance . </s>
<s> Halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first . </s>
<s> House Speaker Sam Rayburn ( D. , Tex. ) called the Kennedy program `` a mighty fine thing '' , but made no prediction on its fate in the House . </s>
<s> Washington , Feb. 9 </s>
<s> -- Acting hastily under White House pressure , the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation's federal housing chief . </s>
<s> Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote . </s>
<s> A number of scattered `` ayes '' and `` noes '' was heard . </s>
<s> Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency . </s>
<s> In the last eight years , all Presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor . </s>
<s> Enforce by demand </s>
<s> The rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse ( D. , Ore. ) in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961 . </s>
<s> Oslo </s>
<s> The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . </s>
<s> This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . </s>
<s> In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems . </s>
<s> This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . </s>
<s> The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . </s>
<s> Explosion avoided </s>
<s> In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . </s>
<s> The general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council . </s>
<s> There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance . </s>
<s> Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive . </s>
<s> Even Norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO line . </s>
<s> On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for . </s>
<s> One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's speeches as `` inconclusive '' . </s>
<s> But he hastened to add that , if United States policies were not always clear , despite Mr. Rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy . </s>
<s> Exploratory mood </s>
<s> A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair , with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited . </s>
<s> The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity , that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots . </s>
<s> The Secretary of State himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months . </s>
<s> But where the core of NATO is concerned , the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance , `` cornerstone '' of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO's disposal in European waters . </s>
<s> The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole . </s>
<s> Conflict surveyed </s>
<s> The secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of NATO realization that East-West friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection . </s>
<s> The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions : more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent . </s>
<s> This increase in the `` threshold '' , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to come . </s>
<s> Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled . </s>
<s> Washington </s>
<s> The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time . </s>
<s> There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos . </s>
<s> The United States , State Department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam . </s>
<s> They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this . </s>
<s> The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated . </s>
<s> But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility . </s>
<s> Policies modified </s>
<s> The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos , rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference . </s>
<s> This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make . </s>
<s> It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration . </s>
<s> Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas . </s>
<s> But with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises : </s>
<s> How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression ? ? </s>
<s> Former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union . </s>
<s> He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory . </s>
<s> GOP restrained </s>
<s> It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it . </s>
<s> They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans , if they had been in power , would have made `` amateurish and monumental blunders '' in Cuba . </s>
<s> One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration on this score . </s>
<s> His reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now . </s>
<s> But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first . </s>
<s> The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B. Morton ( R ) of Kentucky , chairman of the Republican National Committee , that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination . </s>
<s> Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard , Boston University , Brandeis , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators . </s>
<s> Detente urged </s>
<s> This group pleads with the administration to `` give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups '' . </s>
<s> It recommends that the United States `` seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations ; ; </s>
<s> and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds '' . </s>
<s> Mr. Nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation . </s>
<s> But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated . </s>
<s> Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos , almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and the professors . </s>
<s> Aid plans revamped </s>
<s> Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration . </s>
<s> Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements . </s>
<s> Policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed . </s>
<s> But thus far there has been no response in kind . </s>
<s> Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations . </s>
<s> In Laos , the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture . </s>
<s> Again and again it asked the Communists to `` freeze '' the military situation in Laos . </s>
<s> But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate . </s>
<s> And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a `` great service '' and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization . </s>
<s> SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos . </s>
<s> But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos . </s>
<s> ( Some SEATO nations disagreed , however . </s>
<s> ) </s>
<s> There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , Thailand and South Viet Nam . </s>
<s> The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos . </s>
<s> The pro-Western government , which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma `` neutralist '' government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army . </s>
<s> There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt . </s>
<s> If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma , whom it felt was too trusting of Communists , it gradually had to relinquish them . </s>
<s> One factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . </s>
<s> He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by `` encouraging the removal '' of Prince Souvanna . </s>
<s> Washington </s>
<s> The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States . </s>
<s> The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the `` vitality of the nation '' . </s>
<s> In an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime , to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems . </s>
<s> The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend . </s>
<s> Offenses multiply </s>
<s> The President has also called upon the Attorney General , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts `` in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem . </s>
<s> Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett , a special assistant to the Attorney General , as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime . </s>
<s> His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in offenders . </s>
<s> Among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age . </s>
<s> East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , Raymond H. Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes . </s>
<s> Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally '' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time . </s>
<s> East Providence now has no civil defense program . </s>
<s> Mr. Hawksley , the state's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years . </s>
<s> He is not interested in being named a full-time director . </s>
<s> Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program , Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director . </s>
<s> He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs . </s>
<s> Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job . </s>
<s> One of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin , he said . </s>
<s> Along with a director , the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized . </s>
<s> Mr. Hawksley said . </s>
<s> One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program . </s>
<s> Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he said . </s>
<s> Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station . </s>
<s> He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area . </s>
<s> Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack . </s>
<s> The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would be another . </s>
<s> Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point . </s>
<s> Mr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack . </s>
<s> Such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know . </s>
<s> If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director , Mr. Hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally . </s>
<s> One of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid . </s>
<s> Other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government . </s>
<s> Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind . </s>
<s> Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly . </s>
<s> The governor's move into the so-called `` blue law '' controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R. Grant , deputy city clerk of Central Falls . </s>
<s> A copy was released to the press . </s>
<s> Mr. Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant . </s>
<s> The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature . </s>
<s> While the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review , Mr. Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent to get `` the benefit of his views '' . </s>
<s> He will then appoint the study committee with Mr. Nugent's cooperation , the governor said . </s>
<s> `` I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings '' , Mr. Notte said , `` to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws '' . </s>
<s> The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time `` with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales '' . </s>
<s> The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws . </s>
<s> Should there be evidence they are shirking , he has said , the state police will step into the situation . </s>
<s> There has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws . </s>
<s> The statutes , similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath . </s>
<s> The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday . </s>
<s> The only day they `` have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday '' , the council's resolution said . </s>
<s> The small shops `` must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community '' , according to the resolution , which added that they `` also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors '' . </s>
<s> It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide `` great revenue '' to the local government . </s>
<s> The council advised the governor that `` large supermarkets , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business '' on Sunday . </s>
<s> They `` operate on a volume basis '' , it was contended , `` and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community '' . </s>
<s> Liberals and conservatives in both parties -- Democratic and Republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , George H. Reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday . </s>
<s> Mr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the `` welfare '' type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system . </s>
<s> He suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day . </s>
<s> He said he was `` confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910 '' . </s>
<s> That , he added , was when he was `` a very young man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade . </s>
<s> `` That was before I studied law . </s>
<s> Some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist Party . </s>
<s> The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist track . </s>
<s> He steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track '' . </s>
<s> He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources . </s>
<s> He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties . </s>
<s> Mr. Reama , who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co. in 1955 said , `` Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it '' . </s>
<s> He said he favors wage increases for workers -- `` but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze '' -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added . </s>
<s> Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , Mr. Reama said : `` A Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own '' . </s>
<s> Mr. Reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling . </s>
<s> A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town . </s>
<s> William A. Martinelli , chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr. . </s>
<s> The law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that post . </s>
<s> Mr. Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days . </s>
<s> He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work . </s>
<s> A difference of opinion arose between Mr. Martinelli and John P. Bourcier , town solicitor , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled . </s>
<s> Mr. Martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while Mr. Bourcier said that a special election might be called instead . </s>
<s> Mr. Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior Court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures . </s>
<s> He assured Mr. Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible . </s>
<s> Mr. Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement . </s>
<s> He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes . </s>
<s> `` After inspiring this , I think we should certainly follow through on it '' , he declared . </s>
<s> `` It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement '' . </s>
<s> He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission . </s>
<s> `` Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement '' , he indicated , `` and to tell them what this will mean for the town '' . </s>
<s> He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September . </s>
<s> Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter . </s>
<s> Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated . </s>
<s> Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed `` false pretenses '' . </s>
<s> Several signers affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system . </s>
<s> Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting . </s>
<s> Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A. Abatuno to draft the ordinance . </s>
<s> At the last session of the General Assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective . </s>
<s> Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation . </s>
<s> At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition . </s>
<s> Local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense . </s>
<s> Plainfield </s>
<s> -- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is `` Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism '' . </s>
<s> Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr. R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . </s>
<s> The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . </s>
<s> It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs . </s>
<s> Hughes said Monday , `` It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired . </s>
<s> Now he's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state '' . </s>
<s> Sunday he had added , `` We can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership '' . </s>
<s> Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign . </s>
<s> `` How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this '' ? ? </s>
<s> He asked . </s>
<s> The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican `` and proud to have absorbed his philosophy '' while working in his adminstration . </s>
<s> Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue . </s>
<s> Regrets attack </s>
<s> Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president . </s>
<s> `` He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign '' , he said , `` because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign '' . </s>
<s> The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark . </s>
<s> Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary . </s>
<s> He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign . </s>
<s> State aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority , and making New Jersey attractive to new industry . </s>
<s> Decries joblessness </s>
<s> Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate `` Must share the blame for this '' . </s>
<s> Noting that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co. plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform . </s>
<s> `` But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time '' , Mitchell said . </s>
<s> Jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for Mitchell . </s>
<s> He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises . </s>
<s> `` He calls for help while saying he is against centralization , but you can't have it both ways '' , Jones said . </s>
<s> The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , `` and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue '' . </s>
<s> Defends Ike </s>
<s> Earlier , Mitchell said in a statement : </s>
<s> `` I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J. Hughes . </s>
<s> His reference to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations . </s>
<s> `` I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste . </s>
<s> `` Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature . </s>
<s> It can only rebound to Mr. Hughes' discredit '' . </s>
<s> Sees Jones ahead </s>
<s> Sen. Charles W. Sandman , R-Cape May , said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination . </s>
<s> Sandman , state campaign chairman for Jones , was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel , Newark , of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones . </s>
<s> Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years . </s>
<s> Sandman said : `` The announcement that Sen. Clifford Case Aj , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveaway . </s>
<s> It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New Jersey's problems . </s>
<s> `` We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington . </s>
<s> That failed . </s>
<s> `` We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case's candidacy of last year . </s>
<s> That , too , will fail '' . </s>
<s> Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave. , Westfield , as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee . </s>
<s> Mrs. Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman . </s>
<s> County Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets , who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them . </s>
<s> The proposal , Sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a `` lip service word '' . </s>

<s> Attacks Republicans </s>
<s> In his only attack on the Republicans , Hughes said , `` The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary . </s>

<s> He said , `` You can see signs of the Republicans' feeble attack on the Meyner administration . </s>

<s> Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates . </s>
<s> At the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable . </s>
<s> Some anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years . </s>
<s> The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders . </s>
<s> Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party . </s>
<s> Opposition reported </s>
<s> Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary . </s>
<s> These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city . </s>
<s> Their view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor . </s>
<s> In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , Mr. Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A. Buckley , the Bronx Democratic leader , and with Joseph T. Sharkey , the Brooklyn Democratic leader . </s>
<s> Mayor visits Buckley </s>
<s> As usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with Carmine G. De Sapio , the Manhattan leader . </s>
<s> He is publicly on record as believing Mr. De Sapio should be replaced for the good of the party . </s>
<s> Last night the Mayor visited Mr. Buckley at the Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation . </s>
<s> Apparently he believes Mr. Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle . </s>
<s> In talks with Mr. Buckley last week in Washington , the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent to dropping Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa , who lives in the Bronx , from this year's ticket . </s>
<s> But Mr. Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr. Gerosa's successor . </s>
<s> Screvane and Beame hailed </s>
<s> The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr. Screvane , who lives in Queens , to replace Abe Stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr. Beame , who lives in Brooklyn , to replace Mr. Gerosa as the candidate for Controller . </s>

<s> Boston , June 16 </s>
<s> -- A wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in Massachusetts . </s>
<s> There is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics . </s>
<s> The taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are `` all the same '' . </s>
<s> `` It's ' See Joe , see Jim ' '' , he says . </s>
<s> `` The hand is out '' . </s>
<s> A political scientist writes of the growth of `` alienated voters '' , who `` believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control . </s>
<s> These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to plunder them '' . </s>
<s> Corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin O'Connor's novel , `` The Last Hurrah '' . </s>
<s> But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject . </s>
<s> A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year . </s>
<s> Graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigations . </s>
<s> And the election of President Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state . </s>
<s> A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , is the norm in Massachusetts public life . </s>

<s> -- Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers . </s>
<s> In the Senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition . </s>
<s> In the House , the Southern-Republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration's housing bill , while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill . </s>
<s> The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee . </s>
<s> It is expected to be reported out Tuesday , but this is a little uncertain . </s>
<s> The panel's action depends on the return of Representative James W. Trimble , Democrat of Arkansas , who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor . </s>
<s> Mr. Trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday . </s>
<s> Leadership is hopeful </s>
<s> The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans . </s>
<s> The Democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week . </s>
<s> The $6,100,000,000 measure , which was passed last Monday by the Senate , provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families . </s>
<s> It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories . </s>
<s> The education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee , where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are balking because of the religious controversy . </s>
<s> They are James J. Delaney of Queens and Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts . </s>
<s> Three groups to meet </s>
<s> What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National Defense Education Act of 1958 . </s>
<s> This would provide for long-term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics . </s>
<s> Mr. Delaney and Mr. O'Neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the House Education and Labor Committee . </s>
<s> About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps . </s>
<s> In the $40,000,000 budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval , $26,000,000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies . </s>
<s> Twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage , Gordon Boyce , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a Washington interview . </s>
<s> Six of these were proposed by religious groups . </s>
<s> They will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia , Africa , the Middle East and Latin America . </s>
<s> Question raised </s>
<s> Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals . </s>
<s> There are a number of ways this could happen , the churchmen pointed out , and here is an example : </s>
<s> Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled . </s>
<s> When he protested , the hotel owner said : </s>
<s> `` Why do you worry ? ? </s>
<s> The U. S. Government is paying for it . </s>
<s> The U. S. Government pays for all its overseas workers '' . </s>
<s> Missionary explains </s>
<s> `` I don't work for the Government '' , the American said . </s>
<s> `` I'm a missionary '' . </s>
<s> The hotel owner shrugged . </s>
<s> `` Same thing '' , he said . </s>
<s> And then , some churchmen remarked , there is a more classical church-state problem : </s>
<s> Can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ? ? </s>
<s> R. Sargent Shriver Jr. , director of the corps , is certain that they can . </s>
<s> No religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive Peace Corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes . </s>

<s> Indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of Asia , Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid . </s>

<s> United Nations , N. Y. , June 18 </s>
<s> -- A committee of experts has recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United Nations . </s>
<s> This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United Nations . </s>
<s> One effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as India . </s>
<s> India is the most populous United Nations member with more than 400,000,000 inhabitants . </s>

<s> -- Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20 . </s>
<s> Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F. Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D. Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route . </s>
<s> Pennsylvania Avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint . </s>
<s> But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it . </s>
<s> Many buildings </s>
<s> Within view of the avenue are some of the United States government's tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments . </s>
<s> Of course , 1600 Pennsylvania , the White House , is the most famous address of the free world . </s>
<s> Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about seven-stories high . </s>
<s> Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about 169 years old . </s>
<s> In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade . </s>
<s> They were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote . </s>
<s> In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time . </s>
<s> Seats on square </s>
<s> Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National Archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country's most valuable records are kept . </s>
<s> Also the department of justice building is located where J. Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation . </s>
<s> Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania , powered with lines that are underground . </s>
<s> Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering Lafayette Square , opposite the White House . </s>
<s> In this historic square are several statues , but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen. Andrew Jackson , hero of the Battle of New Orleans . </s>
<s> Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will be at least 40 marching units . </s>
<s> About 16,000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade . </s>

<s> -- What does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi ? ? </s>
<s> Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political future . </s>
<s> This is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- Gov. Ross Barnett . </s>
<s> Barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well . </s>
<s> Consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year . </s>
<s> Could be scramble </s>
<s> Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far . </s>
<s> The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's office . </s>
<s> There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble . </s>
<s> Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful `` honeymoon '' he had in the 1960 legislative session . </s>
<s> If Barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session . </s>
<s> The odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year . </s>
<s> Districts issue </s>
<s> Legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating . </s>
<s> Barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure . </s>
<s> The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat . </s>
<s> With eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic Delta district , and Congressman Frank E. Smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature . </s>
<s> Mississippi's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House . </s>
<s> Split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck . </s>
<s> And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together . </s>
<s> Future clouded </s>
<s> Barnett , as the titular head of the Democratic party , apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary . </s>
<s> With a Democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election . </s>
<s> Now , the picture is clouded , and even US Sens. James O. Eastland and John C. Stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status . </s>
<s> Reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen . </s>
<s> Baton Rouge , La. </s>
<s> -- The Gov. Jimmie H. Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses . </s>
<s> The year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue . </s>
<s> But it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government . </s>
<s> The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent . </s>
<s> The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program . </s>
<s> But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation . </s>
<s> Legislators weary </s>
<s> Indeed , the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat . </s>
<s> The administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program . </s>
<s> The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote . </s>
<s> The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenes . </s>
<s> Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy . </s>
<s> If it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration . </s>
<s> He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature . </s>
<s> Actually , Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway . </s>
<s> Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration . </s>
<s> This is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly . </s>
<s> They would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be ineffectual . </s>
<s> Underlying concern </s>
<s> Passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition . </s>
<s> He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle . </s>
<s> Then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period . </s>
<s> It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one . </s>
<s> But if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes . </s>
<s> This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash . </s>
<s> It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year . </s>
<s> If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma . </s>
<s> Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues . </s>
<s> Constant problem </s>
<s> In either case , it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser . </s>
<s> The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor . </s>
<s> It is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem . </s>
<s> But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature . </s>
<s> This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year . </s>
<s> A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize . </s>
<s> Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves . </s>
<s> The new year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms . </s>
<s> City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track '' with the city . </s>
<s> Estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000 job have ranged as high as $200,000 . </s>
<s> Shortcuts unnoticed </s>
<s> Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate '' bids of competing contractors . </s>
<s> The Hughes concern then took `` shortcuts '' on the project but got paid anyway , Hemphill said . </s>
<s> The Controller's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday : </s>

<s> The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project . </s>
<s> The signature of Harold V. Varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public Property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project . </s>
<s> Varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor . </s>
<s> Managing Director Donald C. Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter . </s>
<s> The announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city and the PTC as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959 . </s>

<s> Siebern hits homer </s>
<s> Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . </s>
<s> Then Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . </s>
<s> A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . </s>

<s> Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser , a wild pitch , and Frank Cipriani's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into center . </s>
<s> The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers . </s>
<s> Three were doubles , Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one . </s>
<s> Hartman impressive </s>
<s> Bill Kunkel , Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium . </s>
<s> The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourth . </s>
<s> Hartman , purchased by the A's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance , and merited the triumph . </s>
<s> Keegan , a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder , gave up the Orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally . </s>
<s> Robinson doubles again </s>
<s> In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left . </s>
<s> Whitey Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base on balls . </s>
<s> Then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce . </s>
<s> Pete Ward was sent in for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short . </s>
<s> John Powell , batting for Adair , fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches , and Buddy Barker , up for Stepanovich , bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest . </s>
<s> The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding , along with Robinson , the two Birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate . </s>
<s> The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out . </s>
<s> Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally . </s>
<s> Lumpe errs </s>
<s> Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single , and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error . </s>
<s> Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners . </s>
<s> When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut down in a close play at third , Tuttle to Andy Carey . </s>
<s> The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went like this : </s>
<s> Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center . </s>
<s> Carey Singles </s>
<s> Carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first . </s>
<s> It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit . </s>
<s> Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play . </s>
<s> Breeding to Adair to Gentile , setting up Tuttle's 390-foot homer over the wall in left center . </s>

<s> -- A Texas halfback who doesn't even know the team's plays , Eldon Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games . </s>
<s> Time stands still every time Moritz , a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran , goes into the field . </s>
<s> Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday , in fact -- out of football . </s>
<s> Moritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl . </s>
<s> That's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries . </s>
<s> He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington State . </s>
<s> Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team . </s>
<s> But ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you'll get the quick response , `` place-kicker '' . </s>
<s> A 208-pound , 6-foot 1-inch senior from Stamford , Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking . </s>
<s> Last year , when he worked out at halfback all season , he didn't get into a single game . </s>
<s> `` This year , coach Royal told me if I'd work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me '' , said Moritz . </s>
<s> `` So I started practicing on it in spring training . </s>
<s> Moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and , as a result , several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough . </s>
<s> Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and , as a result , he hopes to start practicing field goals this week . </s>
<s> He kicked several while playing at Stamford High School , including one that beat Anson , 3-0 , in a 1953 district game . </s>
<s> `` I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school '' , he said , `` and made 26 in a row at one time . </s>
<s> I never did miss one in a playoff game -- I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years '' . </s>
<s> Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury . </s>
<s> He missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956 . </s>
<s> His statistical record that year , when Texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive : he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards . </s>
<s> He went into the Army in March , 1957 , and returned two years later . </s>
<s> But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season . </s>
<s> Place kicking is largely a matter of timing , Moritz declared . </s>
<s> `` Once you get the feel of it , there's not much to it . </s>
<s> I've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can't seem to get the feel . </s>
<s> Practice helps you to get your timing down . </s>
<s> `` It's kind of like golf -- if you don't swing a club very often , your timing gets off '' . </s>

<s> Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling , I think , on the part of the coaches and the players . </s>
<s> We needed it and we got it '' . </s>
<s> Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon . </s>
<s> Both turned in top jobs for the second straight game . </s>
<s> `` Nelson played magnificent football '' , Meek praised . </s>
<s> `` He knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times . </s>
<s> And he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown . </s>
<s> He broke that boy ( Air Force fullback Nick Arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football '' . </s>
<s> Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons' aerial thrusts in the late stages . </s>
<s> One was on a fourth-down screen pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory . </s>
<s> `` As soon as it started to form , Gannon spotted it '' , Meek said . </s>
<s> `` He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback Terry Isaacson ) had time to turn around . </s>
<s> He really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss '' . </s>
<s> The Air Force's , and the game's , final play , was a long pass by quarterback Bob McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards . </s>
<s> `` He just lay back there and waited for it '' , Meek said . </s>
<s> `` He almost brought it back all the way '' . </s>
<s> Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice . </s>
<s> `` Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game '' , Meek said . </s>
<s> `` He'll be out of action all this week . </s>

<s> Exclaimed Stram . </s>
<s> `` Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way '' . </s>
<s> Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , Jack Spikes , though he did the team's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury . </s>
<s> `` Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well '' , said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game . </s>
<s> `` In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job '' . </s>
<s> The Texans won the game through ball control , with Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes . </s>
<s> `` We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack '' , explained Stram . </s>
<s> `` They can be going along , doing little damage , then bang , bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble '' . </s>
<s> The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off . </s>
<s> The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes , the flashy halfback . </s>
<s> He was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yards . </s>
<s> The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver's Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas . </s>

<s> Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts . </s>
<s> It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone . </s>

<s> It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . </s>
<s> The Denver-area TV audience was privileged to see Mays' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home . </s>
<s> This rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top rulers . </s>

<s> Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings , the newest National Football League entry . </s>
<s> Van Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday . </s>
<s> Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player . </s>
<s> With Skorich at the helm , the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing . </s>
<s> In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerials . </s>
<s> Skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing . </s>
<s> Coach played 3 years </s>
<s> Skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers . </s>

<s> Frank Graham , the Journal-American sports columnist ; ; </s>
<s> Bill Mazeroski , the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates , and Casey Stengel , the former manager of the Yankees . </s>

<s> The 53-year-old Shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York . </s>
<s> Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James A. Farley , Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume , Shea worked relentlessly . </s>
<s> His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city . </s>
<s> The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees . </s>
<s> Despite countless barriers and disappointments , Shea moved forward . </s>
<s> When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another National League club to move here . </s>
<s> When that failed , he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid in the formation of a third major league , the Continental , with New York as the key franchise . </s>
<s> The Continental League never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand . </s>
<s> Flushing stadium in works </s>
<s> The New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson . </s>
<s> A big-league municipal stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C. Frick . </s>
<s> Shea's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium . </s>
<s> Shea and his wife , Nori , make their home at Sands Point , L. I. . </s>
<s> Bill Jr. , 20 , Kathy , 15 , and Patricia , 9 , round out the Shea family . </s>
<s> Shea was born in Manhattan . </s>
<s> He attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University in Washington . </s>
<s> He played basketball there while working toward a law degree . </s>
<s> Later , Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians , a minor league professional football team . </s>
<s> He was the lawyer for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National Football League . </s>
<s> All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the local National Leaguers yesterday . </s>
<s> On Friday , Roger Maris , the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League's most-valuable-player award , will meet with Roy Hamey , the general manager . </s>
<s> Maris is in line for a big raise . </s>
<s> Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association tonight . </s>
<s> The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre . </s>
<s> Palmer , golf's leading money-winner in 1960 , and Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin . </s>
<s> Deane Beman , the National Amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including Bob Gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards . </s>
<s> The writers' Gold Tee Award will go to John McAuliffe of Plainfield , N. J. , and Palm Beach , Fla. , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments . </s>

<s> The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington , Democrat of Missouri . </s>
<s> Golf's golden boy </s>
<s> Arnold Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months . </s>
<s> He won the Masters , the United States Open and a record $80,738 in prize money . </s>
<s> He was heralded as `` Sportsman of the Year '' by Sports Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the `` Professional Athlete of the Year '' , a distinction that earned for him the $10,000 diamond-studded Hickok Belt . </s>
<s> But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot . </s>
<s> A couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole . </s>
<s> It made him human . </s>
<s> And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair . </s>
<s> If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all . </s>
<s> It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold . </s>
<s> He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all . </s>
<s> The world's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher . </s>
<s> He boomed a 280-yard drive . </s>
<s> Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance . </s>
<s> No margin for error </s>
<s> On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot . </s>
<s> The ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice . </s>
<s> He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds . </s>
<s> He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side . </s>
<s> `` It is possible that I over-corrected '' , he said ruefully . </s>
<s> Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes . </s>
<s> So he wound up with a dozen . </s>
<s> `` It was a nice round figure , that 12 '' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed . </s>
<s> From the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open . </s>
<s> The idol of the hackers , of course , is Ray Ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the United States Open . </s>
<s> Their secondary hero is another pro , Willie Chisholm , who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully . </s>
<s> Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes , who tried to keep count . </s>
<s> Stickler for rules </s>
<s> `` How many is that , Jim '' ? ? </s>
<s> Asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project . </s>
<s> `` Thirteen '' , said Long Jim . </s>
<s> `` Nae , man '' , said Willie , `` ye must be countin' the echoes '' . </s>
<s> He had a 16 . </s>
<s> Palmer's dozen were honestly earned . </s>
<s> Nor were there any rules to save him . </s>
<s> If there had been , he would have found a loophole , because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book . </s>
<s> This knowledge has come in handy , too . </s>
<s> His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway . </s>
<s> The ball floated downstream . </s>
<s> A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie . </s>
<s> Arnold sent for Joe Dey , the executive secretary of the golf association . </s>
<s> Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream . </s>
<s> `` I knew it all along '' , confessed Arnold with a grin , `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' . </s>
<s> For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings . </s>
<s> Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors . </s>
<s> He'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he's right . </s>
<s> That's how he first won the Masters in 1958 . </s>
<s> It happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder . </s>
<s> Arnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force . </s>
<s> Ruling from on high </s>
<s> `` I can remove the ball , can't I '' ? ? </s>
<s> Asked Palmer of an official . </s>
<s> `` No '' , said the official . </s>
<s> `` You must play it where it lies '' . </s>
<s> `` You're wrong '' , said Arnold , a man who knows the rules . </s>
<s> `` I'll do as you say , but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling '' . </s>
<s> He scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one . </s>
<s> The golfing fathers ruled in his favor . </s>
<s> So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke . </s>
<s> Until a few weeks ago , however , Arnold Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers . </s>
<s> But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before . </s>
<s> A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today . </s>
<s> Other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through Saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football's hall of fame , players' benefits and constitutional amendments . </s>
<s> The owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division . </s>
<s> However , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks . </s>
<s> Pete Rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out : </s>
<s> `` We'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other '' . </s>
<s> Nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates . </s>
<s> If the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies , they won't be misled by the Pirates' slower start this season . </s>
<s> `` Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat '' , Mauch said here the other day . </s>
<s> `` The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year . </s>
<s> They have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season , along with Bobby Shantz '' . </s>
<s> Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals , who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's world champions . </s>
<s> The Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7-9 . </s>
<s> Change in pitchers . </s>
<s> Solly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio , for several reasons : 1 Broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago ; ; </s>
<s> 2 The desire to give Broglio as many starts as possible ; ; </s>
<s> 3 The Redbirds' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday . </s>
<s> Manager Hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignment . </s>
<s> After Thursday's open date , Solly plans to open with Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night . </s>
<s> Harvey Haddix , set back by the flu this season , will start against his former Cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain Kenny Boyer in tonight's game at Busch Stadium . </s>
<s> Boyer is suffering from a stiff neck . </s>
<s> Haddix has a 13-8 record against the Redbirds , despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960 . </s>
<s> Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh said he hadn't decided between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday's game . </s>
<s> Mizell has won both of his starts . </s>
<s> Nieman kept in lineup . </s>
<s> After a lengthy workout yesterday , an open date , Hemus said that Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup . </s>
<s> That means Stan Musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the Giants . </s>
<s> `` I have to stay with Nieman for a while '' , Hemus said . </s>
<s> `` Bill White ( sore ankles ) should be ready . </s>
<s> With a lefthander going for Pittsburgh , I may use Don Taussig in center '' . </s>
<s> `` Lindy McDaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes , and he looked good '' , Hemus said . </s>
<s> `` He should be getting back in the groove before long . </s>
<s> Our pitching is much better than it has shown '' . </s>
<s> The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice , but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday . </s>
<s> Six Bucks over . </s>
<s> Until the Bucs' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over . </s>
<s> Despite the recession , Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : Smoky Burgess , Gino Cimoli , Bill Virdon , Bob Clemente and Dick Groat , each </s>
<s> , Dick Stuart , Don Hoak </s>
<s> and Bob Skinner </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> Bill Mazeroski with and Hal Smith with were the only Pirates dragging their feet . </s>
<s> Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit out most of the series is Bob Friend , who was beaten by The Man twice last season on dramatic home runs . </s>
<s> Friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn't likely to see action here this week . </s>
<s> `` We're getting Friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good '' , Murtaugh said . </s>
<s> `` Virdon has been blasting the ball . </s>
<s> No plunkers for him '' . </s>
<s> Six Bucs over . </s>
<s> The Pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by May 1 last year , when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held them even over the season . </s>
<s> On last May 1 , the Cardinals stood at 7-6 , ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone . </s>
<s> In 1958 , the Birds were 3-10 on May 1 . </s>
<s> A year later they were 4-13 . </s>
<s> Since 1949 , the St. Louis club has been below on May 1 just four times . </s>
<s> The '49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning , then fell as low as 12-17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories . </s>
<s> The '52 Cards were 6-7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club's top since 1949 . </s>
<s> Then last season the Birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories . </s>
<s> Since 1949 , the only National League club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team . </s>
<s> Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by May 8 . </s>
<s> The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New York's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 . </s>
<s> They honored the battling Billikens last night . </s>
<s> Speakers at a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St. Louis University players who , in the words of Coach John Benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than I did '' . </s>
<s> The most valuable player award was split three ways , among Glen Mankowski , Gordon Hartweger and Tom Kieffer . </s>
<s> In addition , a special award was given to Bob ( Bevo ) Nordmann , the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury . </s>
<s> `` You often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing '' , Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a little different . </s>
<s> The boys had a tremendous respect for each other's ability . </s>
<s> They knew what they could do and it was often a little more than I thought they could do . </s>
<s> `` Several times I found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk . </s>
<s> We'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say , ' Don't worry , Coach -- we'll get 'em all right ' '' . </s>
<s> The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by Bob Broeg , sports editor of the Post-Dispatch . </s>
<s> Kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as well as his all-round excellent play . </s>
<s> Mankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his performance against Bradley in St. Louis U.'s nationally televised victory . </s>
<s> Benington said , `` I've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day '' . </s>
<s> Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills . </s>
<s> After the coach listed all the boy's faults , Hartweger said , `` Coach before I leave here , you'll get to like me '' . </s>
<s> Mrs. Benington admired Gordon's spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team . </s>
<s> As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl , he said , `` I want to thank coach's wife for talking him into letting me play '' . </s>
<s> Bob Burnes , sports editor of the Globe-Democrat , presented Bob Nordmann with his award . </s>
<s> Bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time . </s>
<s> Within a week after the injury , suffered in St. Louis's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament , Nordmann was sitting on the Bill's bench doing what he could to help Benington . </s>
<s> On the clock given him was the inscription , `` For Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball , 1960-61 '' . </s>
<s> Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the National Invitation Tournament were : Art Hambric , Donnell Reid , Bill Nordmann , Dave Harris , Dave Luechtefeld and George Latinovich . </s>
<s> `` This team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future '' , Benington pointed out . </s>
<s> `` By winning against Bradley , Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams' home courts , they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn't take a super team to do it '' . </s>
<s> St. Louis University found a way to win a baseball game . </s>
<s> Larry Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game , said to be the first in Billiken baseball history , as the Blue and White beat Southeast Missouri State College , 5-1 , at Crystal City . </s>
<s> The victory was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and a tie . </s>
<s> The tie was against Southeast Missouri last Friday . </s>
<s> Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , Len Boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and Dave Ritchie had a home run and a triple . </s>
<s> St. Louis U. was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington University at Ligget Field . </s>
<s> The game opened a busy week for Washington . </s>
<s> The Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy , Ill. , Saturday . </s>
<s> Happy hitting </s>
<s> If it's true that contented cows give more milk , why shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits ? ? </s>
<s> The two top talents of the time , Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations . </s>
<s> And that's meant as a boost , not a knock . </s>
<s> Mays and Mantle , both 10-year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they've never hit the heights . </s>
<s> Their heights , that is . </s>
<s> Mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown season , 1959 , when he batted and also led the American League in home runs , 52 , and rbi's , 130 . </s>
<s> Like the Yankees' slugger , Mays , the terror of the Giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by -- or for -- Willie . </s>
<s> His best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs , drove in 127 and stole 24 bases . </s>
<s> Now , apparently happier under new managers , Mays and Mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they're going to pass those previous peaks . </s>
<s> Labor relations </s>
<s> Yes , we know , they're professionals , men paid to play , and they shouldn't care how they're handled , just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month . </s>
<s> The truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment . </s>
<s> For that matter , Stan Musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effort . </s>
<s> Mantle , it's apparent , resented Casey Stengel's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility . </s>
<s> The old man was almost too possessive . </s>
<s> Stengel inherited DiMaggio , Rizzuto , but he brought up Mantle from Class C to the majors , from Joplin to New York . </s>
<s> With the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him , Ol' Case wanted No. 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielder . </s>
<s> Stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats . </s>
<s> Inheriting a more mature Mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway , Ralph Houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on Mickey . </s>
<s> The Major decided that , rather than be led , the slugger could lead . </s>
<s> And what leadership a proud Mantle has given so far . </s>
<s> The opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field Jr. , Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , Babe Ruth's 60 homers of 1927 . </s>
<s> Four for Alvin </s>
<s> Mays' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year . </s>
<s> Willie's wonderful walloping Sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark . </s>
<s> Next to Leo Durocher , Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the Polo Grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant . </s>
<s> Romantic news concerns Mrs. Joan Monroe Armour and F. Lee H. Wendell , who are to be married at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow in the Lake Forest home of her brother , J. Hampton Monroe , and Mrs. Monroe . </s>

<s> Her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director . </s>
<s> The job also covers a number of other items . </s>
<s> `` Mom '' Marr , as the more than 80 men at the center call her , is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society . </s>
<s> Her day starts early , but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during May , which is National Salvation Army Week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , Mrs. Marr's office is always open and the welcome mat is out . </s>
<s> Mrs. Marr is the first contact a Skid Row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up . </s>
<s> She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures . </s>
<s> `` Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men '' , Mrs. Marr explained . </s>
<s> The Denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center . </s>
<s> `` And I bum tickets to everything I can '' , she said . </s>
<s> `` I've become the greatest beggar in the world '' . </s>
<s> In addition to the tickets to the movies , sporting events and concerts , Mrs. Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system . </s>
<s> Mrs. Marr also has a number of parolees to `` mother '' , watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society . </s>

<s> Home is where a man was born , reared , went to school and , most particularly , where grandma is . </s>
<s> That is where we turn in the good old summertime . </s>

<s> My husband and I , a month ahead of the rush , have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson , Ariz. , to New York City : </s>

<s> I can testify that motels , service and comfort stations ( they go together like Scots and heather ) , dog wagons , roadside restaurants , souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting . </s>
<s> I hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene , such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent , far-flung over-night accommodations . </s>
<s> Maybe motel-keeping isn't the nation's biggest industry , but it certainly looks that way from the highway . </s>
<s> There are motels for all purposes and all tastes . </s>
<s> There are even motels for local weather peculiarities in Shamrock , Tex. , as I discovered . </s>
<s> There the Royal Motel advertises `` all facilities , vented heat , air conditioned , carpeted , free TV , storm cellar '' . </s>
<s> Many with pools </s>
<s> Innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools ( `` swim at your own risk '' is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) . </s>
<s> Some even boast two pools , one for adults and one for children . </s>
<s> But the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar . </s>
<s> Motorists like myself who can remember the old `` tourists accommodated '' signs on farm houses and village homes before World War 2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business . </s>
<s> All for $14 ! ! </s>

<s> The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . </s>
<s> The current monthly payroll comes to about $15,000,000 . </s>
<s> Howard E. Simpson , the railroad's president , said , `` A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action '' . </s>
<s> The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . </s>
<s> Salary cut and lay-offs </s>
<s> It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 </s>
<s> A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . </s>
<s> There are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . </s>
<s> Since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B. & O. spokesman said . </s>

<s> -- The Anne Arundel county school superintendent has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what . </s>
<s> The proposal was made by Dr. David S. Jenkins after he and Mrs. D. Ellwood Williams , Jr. , a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argued for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting . </s>
<s> The disagreement was over what Dr. Jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting . </s>
<s> Cites discrepancies </s>
<s> Mrs. Williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr. Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for the board's approval . </s>
<s> `` I hate to have these things come up again and again '' , Dr. Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion . </s>
<s> `` These are the board's minutes . </s>
<s> I'll write what you tell me to '' . </s>
<s> For a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago . </s>
<s> It was about that time , a board member said later , that Dr. Thomas G. Pullen , Jr. , State superintendent of schools , told Dr. Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him . </s>

<s> London , Feb. 9 </s>
<s> -- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today . </s>
<s> The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year . </s>
<s> It is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs . </s>
<s> It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus , the world's first atomic submarine . </s>
<s> Its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack . </s>
<s> Five held for trial </s>
<s> The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . </s>
<s> A full trial was ordered for : </s>
<s> Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced . </s>
<s> They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard . </s>
<s> Gordon A. Lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be Russian although he carries a Canadian passport . </s>
<s> When arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in Christmas gift wrapping , it was testified . </s>
<s> Flashed to Moscow </s>
<s> A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger , bookseller , and wife , Joyce . </s>
<s> ( In Washington , the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen , an American couple formerly of New York City ) </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> In their suburban cottage the crown charges , the Krogers received secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first Saturday evening of each month , and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow , either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books . </s>
<s> Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing , a printed page , or a manuscript . </s>
<s> All five pleaded innocent . </s>
<s> Only Miss Gee asked for bail . </s>
<s> Her young British lawyer , James Dunlop , pleaded that she was sorely needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother , 80 , her maiden aunt , also 80 and bedridden for 20 years , and her uncle , 76 , who once ran a candy shop . </s>
<s> Refuses to grant bail </s>
<s> `` I am not prepared to grant bail to any of them '' , said the magistrate , K.J.P. Baraclough . </s>
<s> The trial will be held , probably the first week of March , in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus Fuchs , the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s , was sentenced to 14 years in prison . </s>
<s> Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five , who may have altered history in the 1960s . </s>
<s> Fuchs , after nine and a half years , was released , being given time off for good behavior . </s>
<s> He promptly went to communist East Germany . </s>
<s> The magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29,000 in American and British currency , mostly $20 bills , and in British government bonds and stocks . </s>
<s> `` This is Russian money '' , said Mervin Griffith-Jones for the attorney general's office . </s>
<s> He asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow , Lonsdale the Red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's secrets . </s>
<s> `` Of highest value '' </s>
<s> The fact that secrets of the Dreadnought , and thereby of the American undersea fleet , were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier . </s>
<s> But just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , Capt. George Symonds . </s>
<s> He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon , Jan. 7 . </s>
<s> The information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy . </s>
<s> Court cleared </s>
<s> Just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring , watched for six months , was broken remained untold . </s>
<s> The British defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve . </s>
<s> So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour . </s>
<s> Almost any information about the Dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet . </s>
<s> Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed . </s>
<s> The United States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the Skipjack . </s>
<s> With the machinery went a complete design for the hull . </s>
<s> The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub , much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded it . </s>
<s> Navy's future involved </s>
<s> `` Much of the navy's future depends upon her '' , an American naval announcement said on the Skipjack's first arrival in British waters in August , 1959 , for exhibition to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station . </s>
<s> It was there that the two accused civil servants were at work . </s>
<s> `` Her basic hull form ( a teardrop ) and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent Polaris missile submarines '' , the statement went on . </s>
<s> The atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp. . </s>
<s> Thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said . </s>
<s> The hull was also a result of almost a decade of work . </s>
<s> It was first tried out on a conventional submarine , the Albacore , in 1954 . </s>
<s> The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built . </s>
<s> Reputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyers . </s>
<s> It could , reputedly , go 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month . </s>
<s> It was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes . </s>
<s> The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in Miss Gee's purse would , if completed and handed back , have given the Kremlin a complete picture `` of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future '' . </s>
<s> Interested in detector </s>
<s> The spy ring also was particularly interested in ASDIC , the underwater equipment for detecting submarines , it was testified . </s>
<s> Range was a vital detail . </s>
<s> Designs of parts were sought . </s>
<s> Six radiomen told how , twice on two days after the ring was nabbed , a transmitter near Moscow was heard calling , using signals , times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's apartment and the Krogers' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid . </s>
<s> Oddly , the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested . </s>
<s> The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics detail detectives `` is the product of rumor , combined with malice , and individual enmity '' on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph Sam Perry in federal District court . </s>
<s> The three -- Miles J. Cooperman , Sheldon Teller , and Richard Austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws . </s>
<s> In his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , Bernard H. Sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were `` entirely innocent '' . </s>
<s> ' had to know peddlers ' </s>
<s> `` When they became members of the city police narcotics unit '' , Sokol said , `` they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket . </s>
<s> They , on occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers '' . </s>
<s> Although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , Sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were `` aiming at the same criminals '' . </s>
<s> This , he added , brought about `` petty jealousies '' and `` petty personal grievances '' . </s>
<s> `` In the same five year period that the United States says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy '' , Sokol continued , `` these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor's medal '' . </s>
<s> No comments by U.S. </s>
<s> In opening , D. Arthur Connelly , assistant United States attorney , read the indictment , but made no comments . </s>
<s> Attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients' guilt . </s>
<s> Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $4,700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler , Otis Sears , 45 , of 6934 Indiana Av. . </s>
<s> Among other acts , Teller and Austin are accused of paying $800 to Sears . </s>
<s> The first witness , Moses Winston Mardis , 5835 Michigan Av. , a real estate agent and former bail bondsman , took the stand after opening statements had been made . </s>

<s> Circuit Judge Paul R. Cash did not set a date for sentencing . </s>
<s> Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation . </s>
<s> Walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure . </s>
<s> Locked in motel </s>
<s> A verdict against Pohl came at 4:05 p.m. after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation . </s>
<s> The jury , which was locked up in a motel overnight , was canvassed at the request of Walker after the verdict was announced . </s>

<s> The student newspaper , The Emory Wheel , as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation . </s>
<s> `` From its beginning '' , the trustees' statement said Friday , `` Emory University has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learning . </s>
<s> Teaching , research and study , according to highest standards , under Christian influence , are paramount in the Emory University policy . </s>
<s> `` As a private institution , supported by generous individuals , Emory University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and Christian education . </s>
<s> `` There is not now , nor has there ever been in Emory University's charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race , color or creed . </s>
<s> Insofar as its own governing documents are concerned , Emory University could now consider applications from prospective students , and others seeking applications from prospective students , and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university , irrespective of race , color or creed . </s>

<s> William Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $58,918 out of its budgeted $66,000 in the category , leaving only $7,082 for the rest of the month . </s>
<s> At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $17,000 . </s>
<s> But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . </s>
<s> No request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . </s>
<s> Board oks pact </s>
<s> The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . </s>
<s> The contract with Ray Field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month . </s>
<s> Field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes . </s>
<s> Acting Administrator Andrew F. Juras said that because of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program , the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period . </s>
<s> But he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles , and he said he personally `` regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past '' . </s>
<s> He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing , `` and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave '' . </s>
<s> Salary termed modest </s>
<s> Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government . </s>
<s> He also said that the salary , in terms of going rates in the field , was `` modest '' in terms of the man's responsibility . </s>
<s> The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed , he said , and added Field's long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program . </s>

<s> Harvey criticized </s>
<s> Mrs. Peck , later joined by the commission's vice-chairman , Mrs. Lee Patterson , took Harvey to task for comments he had made to the North Portland Rotary Club Tuesday . </s>
<s> A publicity release from Oregon Physicians Service , of which Harvey is president , quoted him as saying the welfare office move to Salem , instead of `` crippling '' the agency , had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses , with the key being improved communications between F & A and the commission staff . </s>
<s> `` I rather resent '' , she said , `` you speaking to those groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished this . </s>
<s> I think you fell short of the real truth in the matter : That the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people . </s>

<s> Seventeen years ago today , German scientist Willy Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a V-1 rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber . </s>
<s> The World War 2 , German bomber rolled down a runway and took off . </s>
<s> The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip . </s>
<s> This had never been done before . </s>
<s> Now a quiet-spoken , middle-aged man , Fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed's Missiles and Space Division at Sunnyvale , where he played a key role in the development of the Navy's Polaris missile . </s>
<s> He sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944 . </s>
<s> `` The first two pilots had crashed '' , he said . </s>
<s> `` I had developed the machines and therefore knew them . </s>
<s> It was time to go up myself '' . </s>
<s> Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler's super-secret `` Reichenberg project '' , which remained unknown to the Allies until after the war . </s>
<s> About 200 of the special V-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead . </s>
<s> The target was Allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the Allied invasion of Europe . </s>
<s> The success of the project depended upon Fiedler's flight . </s>
<s> Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude . </s>
<s> At 12,000 feet , Fiedler signaled `` release '' , and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the Heinkel . </s>
<s> To the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck , hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m.p.h. . </s>
<s> It was probably man's first successful flight in a missile . </s>
<s> `` She flew beautifully '' , said Fiedler . </s>
<s> `` There was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow . </s>
<s> I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip '' . </s>
<s> Using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage . </s>
<s> He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m.p.h. -- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield . </s>
<s> Moments later the V-1 skimmed across the landing strip , edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed . </s>
<s> Fiedler went on to make several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missiles . </s>
<s> The missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb . </s>
<s> Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , striking below the waterline of individual ships . </s>
<s> A crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers , but the project was halted before the end of the war , and the missiles later fell into Allied hands . </s>
<s> Now a family man with three children , Fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at Sunnyvale . </s>
<s> His spare time is spent in soaring gliders . </s>
<s> `` It's so quiet '' , he said , `` so slow , serene -- and so challenging '' . </s>

<s> Probably the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . </s>
<s> For many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous . </s>
<s> It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; </s>
<s> it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell . </s>
<s> Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many . </s>
<s> In fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares . </s>
<s> Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers . </s>
<s> A measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began . </s>
<s> The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.50 a share . </s>
<s> The first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler , Guerin & Turner , the managing underwriter , was at $17 a share . </s>
<s> And from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday morning at around $22 a share . </s>
<s> But the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it was on the market . </s>
<s> Indeed , from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last January , the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up . </s>
<s> Letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation , all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185,000 to the public at $12.50 , with another 5,000 reserved for Morton Foods employes at $11.50 a share ) . </s>
<s> There was even a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas stock offering . </s>
<s> `` We subscribe 500 shares of Morton Foods of Texas . </s>
<s> Cable confirmation '' , it said translated . </s>
<s> But E.G.T. could not let the Swiss bank have even 10 shares . </s>
<s> After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone . </s>
<s> But the result of it all was , E.G.T. partner Dean Guerin believes , an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation . </s>
<s> `` I feel confident the stock will qualify for the ' national list ' '' , he said , meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country . </s>
<s> He was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can do . </s>
<s> But what made the Morton Foods stock issue such a hot one ? ? </s>
<s> The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances . </s>
<s> First , the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months , driving stocks of all kinds up . </s>
<s> As a result , it is not easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings , to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend ) . </s>
<s> Second , the `` potato chip industry '' has caught the fancy of investors lately , and until Morton Foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- Frito and H. W. Lay -- on the market . </s>
<s> Both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months , both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market at , and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run-up . </s>
<s> And third , the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a `` growth '' industry in the public mind of late . </s>
<s> Foods , which long had been considered `` recession resistant '' but hardly dynamic stocks , have been acting like growth stocks , going to higher price-earnings ratios . </s>
<s> The potato chip industry these days is growing , not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods , but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger . </s>
<s> The history of the U.S. potato chip industry is that many of today's successful companies got started during the deep depression days . </s>
<s> Those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives , men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest . </s>
<s> But today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms . </s>
<s> So they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock , and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like Frito . </s>
<s> All those things combined to make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and is . </s>
<s> Now , if Morton's newest product , a corn chip known as Chip-o's , turns out to sell as well as its stock did , the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to . </s>

<s> I am getting dividends on only 50 shares . </s>
<s> In other words , I am getting only half the dividends I should . </s>
<s> Answer </s>
<s> -- Write to the fund's custodian bank -- the First National Bank of Jersey City , N.J. . </s>
<s> That bank handles most of the paper work for Diversified Growth Stock Fund , Fundamental Investors , Diversified Investment Fund and Television-Electronics Fund . </s>

<s> -- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales : `` We've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 10 more . </s>
<s> We sold only four pickers all last year '' . </s>
<s> Gus Ehlers , competitor of Mr. Houtz in this farm community , says his business since August 1 is running 50% above a year earlier . </s>
<s> `` Before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20% '' , he says . </s>
<s> Though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas . </s>
<s> Paradoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output . </s>
<s> Although the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines . </s>
<s> Fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently . </s>
<s> The higher price supports provided by the new legislation , together with rising prices for farm products , are pushing up farm income , making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery . </s>
<s> Seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year . </s>
<s> `` In August our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September retail sales were 14% higher than last year '' , says Mark V. Keeler , farm equipment vice president of International Harvester Co. . </s>
<s> For the year to date , sales of the company's farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960 . </s>
<s> Two of three report gains </s>
<s> Among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states , two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier , with the increases ranging from 5% to 50% . </s>
<s> Not all sections are showing an upswing , however ; ; </s>
<s> the drought-seared North Central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend . </s>
<s> The significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry . </s>
<s> The demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally . </s>
<s> Farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products . </s>
<s> More than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation's trucks , buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances , chemicals and other products . </s>
<s> Farmers are so eager for new machinery that they're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago , dealers report . </s>
<s> `` Farmers aren't as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale '' , says Jack Martin , who sells J. I. Case tractors and implements in Sioux City , Iowa . </s>
<s> `` This morning , we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2,700 model . </s>
<s> Last year , we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine '' . </s>
<s> Mr. Martin sold 21 tractors in August ; ; </s>
<s> in August of 1960 , he sold seven . </s>
<s> Dealers' stocks down </s>
<s> With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country's farm equipment manufacturers . </s>
<s> For example , farm equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed about 5% above a year earlier , Mr. Keeler reports . </s>
<s> Tractor production at Massey-Ferguson , Ltd. , of Toronto in July and August rose to 2,418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier , says John Staiger , vice president . </s>
<s> With the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements . </s>
<s> Merritt D. Hill , Ford Motor Co. vice president , says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers . </s>
<s> Except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 , retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959 . </s>
<s> The rise in sales last winter was checked when the Government's new feed grain program was adopted ; ; </s>
<s> the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and , as a result , reduced the immediate need for machines . </s>
<s> Nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects . </s>
<s> Total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average , three points higher than the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960 . </s>
<s> The Government also is aiding farmers' income prospects . </s>
<s> Agriculture Department economists estimate the Government this year will hand farmers $1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments , well above the record $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960 . </s>
<s> Price support loans may total another $1 billion this year . </s>
<s> With cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 , farmers' gross income is estimated at $39.5 billion , $1.5 billion above 1960's record high . </s>
<s> Net income may reach $12.7 billion , up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953 . </s>
<s> The Government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-September for the third consecutive month , reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-July . </s>
<s> Kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a High Court depletion ruling . </s>
<s> The Supreme Court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined . </s>
<s> The company , in figuring its taxable earnings , deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products . </s>
<s> Such `` depletion allowances '' , in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets . </s>
<s> The High Court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground , not to the revenue from finished products . </s>
<s> A measure passed by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling's impact , on prior-year returns still under review , for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products . </s>
<s> The measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone . </s>
<s> President Kennedy , in signing the relief measure into law , stressed he regarded it as an exception . </s>
<s> `` My approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries '' , the President said . </s>

<s> In such an instance , revenuers stressed , the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received . </s>
<s> A rule on the Federal deductibility of state taxes is contested . </s>
<s> A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax , under Federal law , on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation . </s>
<s> Louisiana , however , collected an income tax on the profits from the sale . </s>
<s> The corporation , in filing its final Federal income return , claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense , as permitted under U.S. tax law . </s>
<s> The Revenue Service disallowed the claim , invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income . </s>
<s> The Tax Court rejected this view . </s>
<s> It said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations . </s>
<s> The Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a year-old I.R.S. ruling on the subject . </s>
<s> The Service has not said what its next step will be . </s>
<s> Peace Corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency . </s>
<s> It provides that the $1,800 termination payment each cadet is to get , after serving a two-year hitch without pay , will be spread over both years , not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received . </s>
<s> The owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and `` kicked back '' to the company's advertising manager , the Tax Court ruled . </s>
<s> The taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager . </s>
<s> The Court upheld the taxpayer's contention that these `` kickbacks '' were not his income though they passed through his hands . </s>
<s> The Court limited its decision to the tax issue involved , commenting : `` It is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction '' . </s>
<s> A portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel . </s>

<s> Hiring the wife for one's company may win her tax-aided retirement income . </s>
<s> A spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls , for example , may be entitled to distributions under the company's pension plan as well as to her own Social Security coverage . </s>
<s> She would be taxed on the pensions when received , of course , but the company's contributions would be tax-free . </s>
<s> A frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement , experts warn , is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income . </s>
<s> In that event , they note , the Revenue Service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law . </s>
<s> Possible upshots : The company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments , or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made . </s>

<s> Contemporary furniture that is neither Danish nor straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern , many design facets , warmth , dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability . </s>
<s> That is the goal of two new collections being introduced in Dallas this month . </s>
<s> Though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the '20's and '40's , two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated , but warm look in contemporary . </s>
<s> These two , Heritage and Drexel , chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece , but a collection of correlated designs , each of which could stand alone . </s>
<s> The Heritage collection , to be shown by Sanger-Harris and Anderson's Studio , has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time . </s>
<s> Called Perennian , to indicate its lasting , good today and tomorrow quality , the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces . </s>
<s> Walnut , wormy chestnut , pecan , three varieties of burl , hand-woven Philippine cane , ceramic tiles , marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence , the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors , brick or paneled walls , windows that bring in the outdoors . </s>
<s> It is a collection with a custom-design look , offering simplicity with warmth , variety and vitality . </s>
<s> The Drexel collection , called Composite , to be shown by Titche's offers a realistic approach to decorating , a mature modern that is a variation of many designs . </s>
<s> Rounded posts give a soft , sculptured look , paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches , table tops are inlaid in Macassar ebony or acacia . </s>
<s> A high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach serving , a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end , recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch long chest . </s>
<s> An interesting approach to the bedroom is presented , with a young , basic , functional group of chests , dressers and corner units and a canted headboard . </s>
<s> The other bedroom has heavier styling , door-fronted dressers with acacia panels , a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror . </s>
<s> Colorful , bright Eastman Chromspun fabrics , with the magenta , pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with Composite . </s>
<s> The fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles . </s>
<s> Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote Drexel's fall 1961 group , Composite . </s>
<s> The spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony , to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top . </s>
<s> See-through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an Oriental shoji flavor . </s>
<s> To bring warmth to the dining area , golden orange tones are used in the fabrics . </s>
<s> Dignity and comfort , in a contemporary manner , reflecting the best aspects of today's design , with substance and maturity , keynote the Perennian collection from Heritage . </s>
<s> Center panel , hand-screened wood , actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases . </s>
<s> Mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander Smith carpet in all wool loop pile . </s>

<s> Giving up the violin opened a whole new career for Ilona Schmidl-Seeberg , a tiny Hungarian who Fritz Kreisler had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage . </s>

<s> She put the violin away and took out some linen , needles and yarn to while away the long , idle days in Budapest . </s>
<s> Now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and , at 26 , she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in Los Angeles . </s>
<s> Her days as an art student at the University of Budapest came to a sudden end during the Hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband Stephen fled to Vienna . </s>
<s> There they continued their studies at the university , she in art , he in architecture . </s>
<s> And there she had her first showing of tapestry work . </s>
<s> There's a lot of talk about the problem of education in America today . </s>
<s> What most people don't seem to realize , if they aren't tied up with the thing as I am , is that 90% of the problem is transportation . </s>
<s> I never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until , at long last , both of my boys got squeezed into high school . </s>
<s> It seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar school . </s>
<s> Getting to and from school was no problem . </s>
<s> They either walked or were driven . </s>
<s> Now they go to a high school that is two miles away . </s>
<s> One might think the problem would be similar . </s>
<s> They could walk , ride on a bus or be driven . </s>
<s> It's much more complex than that . </s>
<s> Generally , they go to school with a girl named Gloriana , who lives down the block , and has a car . </s>
<s> This is a way of getting to school , but , I understand , it entails a certain loss of social status . </s>
<s> A young man doesn't like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn't even in a higher class than he is , and is also a girl . </s>
<s> `` Why don't you walk to school then '' ? ? </s>
<s> I suggested . </s>
<s> `` My father walked , through two miles of snow , in Illinois '' . </s>
<s> `` Did you '' ? ? </s>
<s> I was asked . </s>
<s> `` No '' , I said , `` I didn't happen to grow up in Illinois '' . </s>
<s> I explained , however , that I had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom . </s>
<s> I had to ride a streetcar two miles . </s>
<s> Sometimes the streetcar was late . </s>
<s> Sometimes there weren't even any seats . </s>
<s> I had to stand up , with the ladies . </s>
<s> Sometimes I got on the wrong car and didn't get to school at all , but wound up at the ocean , or some other dismal place , and had to spend the day there . </s>
<s> I've tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then . </s>
<s> When they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car . </s>
<s> She has to have at least one car herself . </s>
<s> I feel a certain loss of status when I am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife , who is only a woman . </s>
<s> Even that isn't satisfactory . </s>
<s> If they have to take any car , they'd rather take the big one . </s>
<s> They say that when they take a car , Gloriana doesn't take her car , but rides with them . </s>
<s> But when Gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her , so the little car isn't big enough . </s>
<s> The logic of that is impeccable , of course , except that I feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car , by my wife , when everybody knows I have a big car and am capable of driving myself . </s>
<s> The solution , naturally , is the bus . </s>
<s> However , it's a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus , and it's too hard on my legs . </s>
<s> My wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there . </s>
<s> But that's hardly realistic . </s>
<s> Nobody walks anymore but crackpots and Harry Truman , and he's already got an education . </s>
<s> Advance publicity on the Los Angeles Blue Book does not mention names dropped as did the notices for the New York Social Register which made news last week . </s>
<s> Published annually by William Hord Richardson , the 1962 edition , subtitled Society Register of Southern California , is scheduled to arrive with Monday morning's postman . </s>
<s> Publisher Richardson has updated the Blue Book `` but it still remains the compact reference book used by so many for those ever-changing telephone numbers , addresses , other residences , club affiliations and marriages '' . </s>
<s> Stars for marriage </s>

<s> Here's an idea for a child's room that is easy to execute and is completely charming , using puppets for lamp bases . </s>
<s> Most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies , and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action , rather than put away in boxes . </s>
<s> Displayed as lamps , the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent . </s>
<s> To create such a lamp , order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop . </s>
<s> Measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket , allowing three to four inches above the puppet's head . </s>
<s> Make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted `` L '' , the foot of the `` L '' about three inches long , so that the puppet can hang directly under the light . </s>
<s> Pulling strings </s>
<s> Using the strings that manipulate the puppet , suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base . </s>
<s> In this way , you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position , with feet , or one foot , barely resting on the pedestal . </s>
<s> If the puppets are of uniform size , you can change them in accord with your child's whims . </s>
<s> Although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony , it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child's playtime . </s>
<s> Those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round . </s>
<s> The scalloped edge is particularly appealing . </s>
<s> Today's trend toward furniture designs from America's past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our Colonial era . </s>
<s> A generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions . </s>
<s> In the background lurked the feeling , however , that these pieces , beautiful as they were , lacked the utilitarian touch . </s>
<s> So junior's bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy , nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the `` hard knocks '' , while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only . </s>
<s> This isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's , according to decorator consultant , Leland Alden . </s>
<s> Housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs , says Mr. Alden and they are doing it largely because Colonial craftsmen had `` an innate sense of the practical '' . </s>
<s> Solid investment </s>
<s> There are a number of reasons why the Eighteenth Century designer had to develop `` down to earth '' designs -- or go out of business . </s>
<s> Hotel Escape's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile `` Kings 4 , Plus Two '' . </s>
<s> This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch . </s>
<s> Show spotlights the Kings -- George Worth , Bill Kay , Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson , flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens . </s>
<s> The Plus Two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid . </s>
<s> In the comedy division , the Kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props . </s>
<s> Net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of which can be classed as pure slapstick . </s>
<s> Kings 4 , have rated as a popular act in Vegas and Western nightclubs . </s>
<s> If they can't chalk up big business here then let's stop this noise about how hip we are , and stick to our community singing , </s>

<s> Is there anything a frustrated individual can do about Communism's growing threat on our doorstep and around the world ? ? </s>
<s> More than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for Jim Kern and his wife Lynn from 4 to 8 p.m. Sunday at First Presbyterian Church . </s>
<s> At that time the second half of the Christian Youth Crusade against Communism will be staged . </s>
<s> A young real estate salesman , Kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by Communism when in the Navy Air Force . </s>
<s> He was particularly struck by a course on Communist brainwashing . </s>
<s> Kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of Communism , but never felt there was anything he , as an individual , could do about it . </s>
<s> When he attended the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade school here about six months ago , Jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it . </s>
<s> The best approach , he figured , was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church . </s>
<s> And he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about Communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote -- a Biblically strong Christianity . </s>
<s> So the Christian Youth Crusade against Communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the four-hour program . </s>
<s> This Sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation ; ; </s>

<s> The Leningrad Kirov Ballet , which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera House , is , I think , the finest `` classical '' ballet company I have ever seen , and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky `` Sleeping Beauty '' with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing . </s>
<s> This work is no favorite of mine . </s>
<s> I am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of Imperial Russia in its most vulgar , infantile , and reactionary aspect ; ; </s>
<s> that its persistent use by ballet companies of the Soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was ; ; </s>
<s> that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the American people ; ; </s>
<s> that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms . </s>
<s> All of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the Kirov's utterly captivating presentation . </s>
<s> Precise </s>
<s> The reasons for this enchantment are numerous , but most of them end in `` ova '' , `` eva '' , or `` aya '' . </s>
<s> In other words , no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet . </s>
<s> It seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests -- Miss Omsk , Miss Pinsk , Miss Stalingr oops , skip it . </s>
<s> These qualities alone , however , would not account for their success , and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective personality . </s>
<s> It is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the American ballet . </s>
<s> Oh-the-pain-of-it , that convention of Russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished Grand Dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety , is totally absent from the Kirov . </s>
<s> This is all the more remarkable because the Kirov is to ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American politics . </s>
<s> But , obviously , at least some things have changed for the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concerned . </s>
<s> Irina Kolpakova , the Princess Aurora of Friday's performance , would be a change for the better anywhere , at any time , no matter who had had the role before . </s>
<s> She is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on , and her dancing has a feminine suavity , lightness , sparkle , and refinement which are simply incomparable . </s>
<s> Hit </s>
<s> Alla Sizova , who seems to have made a special hit in the East , was delightful as the lady Bluebird and her partner , Yuri Soloviev , was wonderfully virile , acrobatic , and poetic all at the same time , in a tradition not unlike that of Nijinsky . </s>
<s> Vladilen Semenov , a fine `` danseur noble '' ; ; </s>
<s> Konstantin Shatilov , a great character dancer ; ; </s>
<s> and Inna Zubkovskaya , an excellent Lilac Fairy , were other outstanding members of the cast , but every member of the cast was magnificent . </s>
<s> The production , designed by Simon Virsaladze , was completely traditional but traditional in the right way . </s>
<s> It was done with great taste , was big and spacious , sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes , but sumptuous in a muted , pastel-like style , with rich , quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery . </s>
<s> Evegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra , one containing excellent soloists -- the violin solos by the concertmaster , Guy Lumia , were especially fine -- but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity . </s>

<s> For A good many seasons I've been looking at the naughty stuff on television , so the other night I thought I ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies . </s>
<s> After all , this year's movies are next year's television shows . </s>
<s> So I went to see `` La Dolce Vita '' . </s>
<s> It has been billed as a towering monument to immorality . </s>
<s> All the sins of ancient Rome are said to be collected into this three-hour film . </s>
<s> If that's all the Romans did , it's a surprise to me that Rome fell . </s>
<s> After television , `` La Dolce Vita '' seems as harmless as a Gray Line tour of North Beach at night . </s>
<s> I cannot imagine a single scene that isn't done in a far naughtier manner on TV every week . </s>
<s> I believe TV watchers will be bored . </s>
<s> `` La Dolce Vita '' has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average TV Western . </s>
<s> Week in , week out , there is more sex to be seen in `` The Adventures Of Ozzie And Harriet '' . </s>
<s> There is more decadence on `` 77 Sunset Strip '' . </s>
<s> There are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series . </s>
<s> In another respect , television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns . </s>
<s> With the exception of Lex Barker and Anita Ekberg , the credits are as unfamiliar as you'll find on the Robert Herridge Theater . </s>
<s> Most of the emphasis has been placed on a `` wild party '' at a seaside villa . </s>
<s> Producer Fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties ! ! </s>
<s> The Dolce Vita get-together boasted a strip tease ( carried as far as a black slip ) ; ; </s>
<s> a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face ; ; </s>
<s> a frigid beauty , and three silly fairies . </s>
<s> Put them all together and they spell out the only four-letter word I can think of : dull . </s>

<s> `` What kind of car is it '' ? ? </s>
<s> He asked gloomily . </s>
<s> `` It is a British Austin , the smallest they make '' . </s>

<s> At last the White House is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master American craftsman , Duncan Phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U. S. Presidents of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishings . </s>
<s> The American Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion's library . </s>
<s> The suite has been in the same family since the early 1800's . </s>
<s> The gift is being presented by `` heirs and descendants of the Rutherford family of New Jersey , whose famous estate , `` Tranquility '' , was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover , N. J. . </s>
<s> Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago . </s>
<s> This acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs . </s>
<s> The AID has undertaken the redecoration of the White House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential home . </s>
<s> It is the AID's intention to create in the library `` a miniature museum of Americana '' before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall . </s>
<s> The room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the Duncan Phyfe furniture . </s>
<s> The AID has found a mantlepiece attributed to Samuel McIntyre of Salem , Mass. , an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the Capitol here in 1792 . </s>
<s> The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem house and is being fitted over the White House library fireplace . </s>
<s> It will be painted to match the paneling in the room . </s>
<s> The AID committee's chairman in charge of the redecoration , Mrs. Henry Francis Lenygon , was in town yesterday to consult with White House staff members on the project . </s>
<s> Mrs. Lenygon's committee associates , announced formally yesterday by the AID in New York , include Mrs. Allen Lehman McCluskey and Stephen J. Jussel , both wellknown Manhattan decorators . </s>

<s> President Kennedy couldn't stay away from his desk for the 75-minute young people's concert played on the White House lawn yesterday by the 85-piece Transylvania Symphony Orchestra from Brevard , N. C. . </s>
<s> But he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music . </s>
<s> At 4 p.m. the President left the White House to welcome the young musicians , students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard Music Center summer camp , and to greet the 325 crippled , cardiac and blind children from the District area who were special guests at the concert . </s>
<s> It was the first in the series of `` Concerts for Young People by Young People '' to be sponsored by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at the White House . </s>
<s> She was not present yesterday , however , to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience . </s>
<s> She is vacationing at the Kennedy summer home in Hyannis Port , Mass. , and in his welcoming remarks , the President said he was representing her . </s>
<s> As he approached the open bandstand , erected facing the South entrance to the Executive Mansion , the band struck up the `` Star Spangled Banner '' and followed it with `` Hail To The Chief '' . </s>
<s> `` I think they played Hail To The Chief better than the Marine Corps Band , and we are grateful to them '' , President Kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor James Christian Pfohl . </s>
<s> After paying tribute to the conductor and his white-clad youthful students , President Kennedy said , `` As an American I have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the United States -- schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music '' . </s>
<s> He added `` I think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field '' . </s>
<s> Displaying his knowledge of music , the New England-born President remarked that `` probably the best chamber music in the world is played in Vermont , by young Americans -- and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers , and their work is being duplicated all across the United States . </s>
<s> `` This is a great national cultural asset , and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me , representing as I do today my wife , to welcome all of you here today at the White House '' . </s>
<s> As he left the bandstand to return to his office , the slender , sun-tanned Chief Executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests . </s>
<s> He expressed surprise to learn that pretty , blonde Patricia Holbrook , 16 , of Mount Rainier , had attended the Joseph P. Kennedy School for the Handicapped in Boston . </s>
<s> `` The nuns there do a wonderful work '' , the President commented . </s>
<s> Patricia now attends the C. Melvin Sharpe Health School in the District . </s>
<s> Each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red , white and blue ribbon . </s>
<s> They enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the White House staff . </s>
<s> Many of the music-loving members of the President's staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience . </s>
<s> And it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected . </s>
<s> Henry Hall Wilson , a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the President's staff as liaison representative with the House of Representatives , turned guest conductor for a Sousa march , the `` Stars and Stripes Forever '' . </s>
<s> Transylvania Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday that Mrs. Kennedy's Social Secretary , Letitia Baldrige , told about plans for White House youth concerts before the National Symphony Orchestra League in Philadelphia last spring . </s>
<s> He said he contacted a friend , Henry Hall Wilson , on the President's staff and asked whether his orchestra could play , in the series . </s>
<s> A flow of correspondence between Pfohl and Miss Baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85-student North Carolina group to play the first concert . </s>
<s> One of the most interested `` students '' on the tour which the Brevard group took at the National Gallery yesterday following their concert at the White House , was Letitia Baldrige , social secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy . </s>
<s> `` I was an art major in college '' , Miss Baldrige explained . </s>
<s> `` I've been here so many times I couldn't count them '' . </s>
<s> She turned out to be a fan , too , of Margaret Bouton , the Gallery's associate curator of education . </s>
<s> Miss Bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed at 5 p.m. . </s>
<s> The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the Gallery at 6 p.m. , remaining for about 45 minutes . </s>
<s> The Brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later . </s>
<s> They decided that they thought Rembrandt's self-portrait made him look `` sad '' ; ; </s>
<s> they noticed Roman buildings in the background of Raphael's `` Alba Madonna '' and `` texture '' in a Monet painting of Rheims Cathedral . </s>
<s> Everybody had heard of Van Gogh , the French impressionist . </s>
<s> Gallery Director John Walker greeted the group , standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them . </s>
<s> He pointed out to the young musicians that the National Gallery `` is the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director , Richard Bales . </s>
<s> I'm sure you've heard of him and his record , ' The Confederacy ' '' . </s>
<s> Along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group , went one of the Gallery's blue-uniformed guards . </s>
<s> In 45 minutes , the Gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the Renaissance to the late 19th Century . </s>
<s> A few of them said they `` preferred contemporary art '' . </s>
<s> Among the other artists , whose paintings were discussed were Boucher , Courbet , Fra Angelico . </s>
<s> The thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the Gallery's rotunda fountain `` because it's on the second floor '' . </s>
<s> That imposing , somewhat austere , and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th St. nw. took on bustling life yesterday . </s>
<s> More than 250 Scottish Rite Masons and guests gathered in their House of the Temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader , Albert Pike , who headed the Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891 . </s>
<s> They came together in the huge , high-ceilinged Council Chamber to hear the late leader eulogized . </s>
<s> C. Wheeler Barnes of Denver , head of the Scottish Rite in Colorado , praised Pike as a historian , author , poet , journalist , lawyer , jurist , soldier and musician , who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the Masonic Order . </s>
<s> The ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of Pike in the House of the Temple . </s>
<s> A reception and tea followed . </s>
<s> About 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States . </s>
<s> The opening session of the 5-day session will begin at 10 a.m. today . </s>
<s> There will be a pilgrimage to Mount Vernon at 2:30 p.m. . </s>

<s> The marriage of John and Mary Black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years . </s>
<s> John had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous . </s>
<s> He would come home in the evening tired and discouraged -- in no frame of mind to play with their three children , or spend much time chatting with his wife . </s>
<s> Hurt by his lack of interest and attention , Mary complained often that he didn't help around the house , and that he didn't really care about the family . </s>
<s> She accused him of ignoring her . </s>
<s> He in turn told her she demanded too much . </s>
<s> They were both discouraged , disgusted and miserable . </s>
<s> Mary decided she had had enough . </s>
<s> Without any definite plan in mind , she went to a judge to see what could be done . </s>
<s> The judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations -- then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from Family Service before going to a lawyer . </s>
<s> Family Service , sharing in UGF , has five agencies in the Washington area . </s>
<s> They offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems . </s>
<s> Because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up , Mr. and Mrs. Black agreed to a series of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia , the agency nearest them . </s>
<s> For nearly a year , they have been receiving counseling , separately and together , in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce . </s>
<s> The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other . </s>
<s> They are now working together toward solving their difficulties . </s>
<s> John received a promotion in his firm . </s>
<s> He gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life . </s>
<s> Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings , and the children's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session of happy , family rough-housing . </s>
<s> To outsiders , the Blacks seem to be an ordinary , happy family , and they are -- but with a difference . </s>
<s> They know the value of being just that -- an ordinary , happy family . </s>
<s> Family Service has helped hundreds of families in this area . </s>
<s> Perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital . </s>
<s> But to the families it serves , their help cannot be measured . </s>
<s> Family Service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the United Givers Fund . </s>
<s> Anticipated heavy traffic along the Skyline Drive failed to materialize yesterday , park rangers said , and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze . </s>
<s> For crucial encounter </s>
<s> One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev . </s>
<s> Mr. Kennedy replied : </s>
<s> `` I'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground '' . </s>
<s> The President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable . </s>
<s> But he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting . </s>
<s> He wanted to buy time to strengthen the U. S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy . </s>
<s> Last Friday the White House announced : </s>
<s> President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 . </s>
<s> The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations . </s>
<s> The heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader . </s>
<s> He was not going to Vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned . </s>
<s> But Mr. Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe . </s>
<s> That objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting . </s>
<s> Despite efforts by Washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting , it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war . </s>
<s> Road to Vienna </s>
<s> The U. S. and Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace `` at the summit of the nations '' . </s>
<s> The first time was in 1955 when a full-dress Big Four summit meeting produced the `` spirit of Geneva '' . </s>
<s> The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads into the Middle East . </s>
<s> In 1959 President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev held an informal session in the U. S. . </s>
<s> That meeting produced the `` spirit of Camp David '' -- a spirit , it later turned out , that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a Berlin settlement . </s>
<s> On the third occasion -- another Big Four summit session at Paris a year ago -- there was no problem of an illusory `` spirit '' . </s>
<s> Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U. S. for the U-2 incident . </s>
<s> The episode tended to confirm the U. S. belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the Allies , rather than genuine negotiation , were the Soviet leader's real aims in summitry . </s>
<s> Pre-inaugural position </s>
<s> Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President , Mr. Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem . </s>
<s> Shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the Soviet leader in these words : </s>
<s> `` As long as Mr. Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither Camp David talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations '' . </s>
<s> The President had set for himself the task , which he believed vital , of awakening the U. S. and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance . </s>
<s> He did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary . </s>
<s> He wanted time , too , to review the United States' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating . </s>
<s> Above all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstep . </s>
<s> Attitude flexible </s>
<s> At the same time the President took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader . </s>
<s> Ideally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels . </s>
<s> But Mr. Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting , provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it . </s>
<s> It would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war , to try to probe Mr. Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear his own views . </s>
<s> Moreover , an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U. S. was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions . </s>
<s> Both elements -- the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson brought back to Russia late in February . </s>
<s> The letter , dated Feb. 22 , was delivered to Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk , Siberia , on March 9 . </s>
<s> It dealt mainly with a broad range of East-West issues . </s>
<s> But it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted . </s>
<s> Developments over the next two months , however , caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing . </s>
<s> There were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly . </s>
<s> Deadlock on tests </s>
<s> The President was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at Geneva . </s>
<s> The deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand for a three-man ( East , West and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machinery . </s>
<s> In the U. S. , strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may be secretly testing . </s>
<s> Mr. Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament . </s>
<s> There was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons , particularly to Communist China . </s>
<s> The question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent . </s>
<s> Moreover , Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the U. N. Secretariat and the International Control Commission for Laos . </s>
<s> Mr. Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible . </s>
<s> Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting . </s>
<s> Initially the White House reaction was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting . </s>
<s> At the same time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist pressure . </s>
<s> In Cuba , the U. S. had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even on its own doorstep . </s>
<s> In Laos , the picture was almost equally bad . </s>
<s> U. S. willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be `` neutralized '' on Soviet terms . </s>
<s> Beyond that , Allied disagreement about military intervention in Laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-Communist forces . </s>
<s> As a result , the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations on Laos , and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast Asia are under increased pressure . </s>
<s> In the light of those events , there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev might overreach himself . </s>
<s> Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive . </s>
<s> He has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out . </s>
<s> The President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as Berlin , Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning back . </s>
<s> It was in the midst of such White House deliberations that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the U. S. Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in the near future . </s>
<s> Mr. Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer by May 20 after consultation with the Allies . </s>
<s> The response from London , Paris and Bonn was favorable . </s>
<s> Firm arrangements for the meeting in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange between Moscow and Washington last week . </s>
<s> Apparently at the insistence of the U. S. , the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow last Friday emphasized the `` informal '' nature of the meeting . </s>
<s> The Washington announcement said : </s>
<s> `` The President and Chairman Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries . </s>
<s> The meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries '' . </s>
<s> The outlook </s>
<s> The Vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned , 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who , in Mr. Kennedy's own words , is `` shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident '' , and a 44-year-old President ( his birthday is May 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy . </s>
<s> The announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the U. S. of both approval and disapproval . </s>
<s> The approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at Vienna . </s>
<s> The inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations . </s>
<s> But those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary . </s>
<s> Mr. Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men . </s>
<s> The feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the President and that plain talk by Mr. Kennedy would give him pause . </s>
<s> Apart from the personal equation , another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U.S. appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit . </s>
<s> Premier Khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway . </s>
<s> This time the initiative came , in part at least , from Washington . </s>
<s> Other allies consulted </s>
<s> There was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr. Khrushchev , the President will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied leaders . </s>
<s> Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity . </s>
<s> Finally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President's making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord . </s>
<s> There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world . </s>
<s> If tests are to be resumed , the argument went , it is vital that the U. S. make plain that the onus belongs to the Soviet Union . </s>
<s> Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse . </s>
<s> After Cuba and Laos , it was argued , Mr. Khrushchev will interpret the President's consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds . </s>
<s> Moreover , the President is meeting the Soviet leader at a time when the Administration has still not decided on the scope of America's firm foreign policy commitments . </s>
<s> The question was raised , for example , as to what attitude the President would take if Mr. Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from Southeast Asia to the Middle East . </s>
<s> There are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . </s>
<s> Mollusks are a case in point . </s>
<s> The shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . </s>
<s> Though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . </s>
<s> There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . </s>
<s> The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . </s>
<s> By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . </s>
<s> There is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture . </s>
<s> Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university . </s>
<s> But the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American Catholic project ; ; </s>
<s> certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy . </s>
<s> Official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds . </s>
<s> American Catholics have responded generously to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning . </s>
<s> They have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made . </s>
<s> Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility . </s>
<s> All of this may be understandable enough : it is , however , in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise . </s>
<s> Yet for better or for worse , the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities . </s>
<s> Community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible . </s>
<s> To understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of American Catholic higher education , it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community . </s>
<s> It is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment . </s>
<s> A religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere . </s>
<s> The fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension . </s>
<s> The net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship . </s>
<s> American Catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of `` private enterprise '' -- the `` private enterprise '' of religious communities . </s>
<s> Had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees . </s>
<s> There is however no point in speculating about such a possibility : the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the `` family business '' . </s>
<s> This `` family-community '' spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement . </s>
<s> It is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American Catholic higher education , in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas . </s>
<s> I think for example of three women's colleges with pitifully small enrollments , clustered within a few miles of a major Catholic university , which is also co-educational . </s>
<s> This is not an isolated example ; ; </s>
<s> this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough . </s>
<s> It would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot . </s>
<s> Apart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there is another aspect of the `` family business '' spirit in American Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny . </s>
<s> For while the past needs of the Church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its `` pursuit of excellence '' . </s>
<s> At the earlier `` pre-academic excellence '' stage of Catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis . </s>
<s> But with today's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for `` outsiders '' becomes more pressing . </s>
<s> The problem is not merely that more `` outside teachers '' are needed but that a different brand is called for . </s>
<s> Commenting on the earlier stage , the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term `` teacher-employee '' ( as opposed to , e.g. , `` maintenance employee '' ) was a not inapt description . </s>
<s> Today however , the `` outsider '' is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university . </s>
<s> And while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement . </s>
<s> In the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it : `` Even with the best of intentions he ( the President of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities . </s>
<s> It is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence ' '' . </s>
<s> The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame : it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually owns '' it , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished `` outside '' faculty . </s>
<s> It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to `` the organization which actually owns the university '' : this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension . </s>
<s> But in any case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one . </s>
<s> `` Outside '' faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business . </s>
<s> There are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university . </s>
<s> In the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel . </s>
<s> Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences . </s>
<s> Expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype . </s>
<s> In the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott : all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere . </s>
<s> To appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the Civil Service . </s>
<s> Much has been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure . </s>
<s> This is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated . </s>
<s> When a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services . </s>
<s> A man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the `` family '' . </s>
<s> Just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions . </s>
<s> Adequate compensation is indispensable . </s>
<s> Yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place . </s>
<s> Broadly speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university . </s>
<s> Religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification . </s>
<s> There is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels . </s>
<s> The college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , are a contribution to the total good of the institution . </s>
<s> But this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation . </s>
<s> The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the `` in-group '' that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself . </s>
<s> This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure . </s>
<s> Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order . </s>
<s> The first is a negative warning : there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority . </s>
<s> In the case of academic personnel the `` feeling '' of participation can hardly be `` faked '' . </s>
<s> Competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own decisions . </s>
<s> Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by `` busy-work '' and ersatz decision making . </s>
<s> In any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all . </s>
<s> In the Notre Dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication '' . </s>
<s> In itself there is nothing wrong with this form of `` participation '' : the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy , i.e. , members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangements . </s>
<s> Sen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . </s>
<s> Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . </s>
<s> Or , in the words of Anatole France , `` The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges '' . </s>
<s> The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . </s>
<s> The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . </s>
<s> In addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill . </s>
<s> It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike . </s>
<s> Business Week ( Aug. 9 , 1961 ) reports that the United Aircraft Company , against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating . </s>
<s> The company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors : advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers . </s>
<s> The company has billed the United States Government for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business . </s>
<s> Rep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee . </s>
<s> The committee remains unresponsive . </s>
<s> Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan been heard from on the matter ; ; </s>
<s> they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions . </s>
<s> The recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained . </s>
<s> The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines ; ; </s>
<s> it must play a game in which there never is a winner . </s>
<s> The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law . </s>
<s> Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy . </s>
<s> Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric , Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market . </s>
<s> The industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied . </s>
<s> The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment . </s>
<s> Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price . </s>
<s> Naturally , enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time . </s>
<s> Should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry . </s>
<s> Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by `` unfair competition '' . </s>
<s> But if they show self-restraint , they don't get the orders . </s>
<s> Under the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted . </s>
<s> Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants . </s>
<s> The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that General Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows . </s>
<s> In other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday . </s>
<s> And which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday ? ? </s>
<s> The question might be asked : `` Don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ? </s>
<s> Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws '' ? ? </s>
<s> The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold , in The Folklore of Capitalism , back in 1937 . </s>
<s> He wrote : `` ( P. 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure . </s>
<s> ( P. 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship . </s>
<s> ( P. 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control . </s>
<s> In this manner , every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws . </s>
<s> ( Pp. 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government '' . </s>
<s> This escape from control has led to management's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while . </s>
<s> A plea of nolo contendere , followed by a nominal fine , after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license . </s>
<s> ( The penalties handed out in the electrical case , which included jail sentences , were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities . </s>
<s> ) </s>
<s> If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest . </s>
<s> A secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle . </s>
<s> However , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational . </s>
<s> Quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union . </s>
<s> Those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform . </s>
<s> Before 1933 , individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English . </s>
<s> The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of Section 7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle . </s>
<s> The Wagner Act , the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining . </s>
<s> The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition . </s>
<s> If a union cannot perform this function , then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud . </s>
<s> The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession . </s>
<s> The problem must be faced squarely . </s>
<s> If laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by the way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them . </s>
<s> Human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America . </s>
<s> As early as 1776 , Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations : `` We have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; ; </s>
<s> but many against combining to raise it '' . </s>
<s> Eighteenth-century England , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies . </s>
<s> In 1825 , the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared : `` It is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies '' . </s>
<s> There were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopoly . </s>
<s> The courts shared the opinion of the employers . </s>
<s> In People vs. Fisher , Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared : </s>
<s> `` Without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it ; ; </s>
<s> but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means '' . </s>
<s> Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin , according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment '' . </s>
<s> Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation . </s>
<s> His bill , allegedly aimed at Hoffa , would amend the Sherman , Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international . </s>
<s> Paradoxically , the same week in which Senator McClellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act . </s>
<s> Indeed , it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws ; ; </s>
<s> for example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers . </s>
<s> At the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates . </s>
<s> The passage of the Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies . </s>
<s> It was most effective against trade unions . </s>
<s> In the famous Danbury Hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices , e.g. , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer . </s>
<s> The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment . </s>
<s> In 1914 , the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity . </s>
<s> The law could not suspend economics . </s>
<s> Labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws . </s>
<s> The courts , by interpretation , emasculated the act . </s>
<s> In 1922 , the United Mine Workers struck the Coronado Coal Company . </s>
<s> The company sued under the anti-trust laws , alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce . </s>
<s> ( What other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise ? ? </s>
<s> ) The court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce . </s>

<s> While Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . </s>
<s> 1 ) Cuba . </s>
<s> Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) . </s>
<s> President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately . </s>
<s> `` There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure '' , said the President . </s>
<s> `` That limit has now been reached '' . </s>
<s> Through Secretary Herter , Ike offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision . </s>
<s> Kennedy , through Secretary-designate of State Dean Rusk , declined . </s>
<s> He thus kept his hands free for any action after Jan. 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the U.S. and Latin America ( see the hemisphere ) . </s>
<s> 2 ) Laos . </s>
<s> After a White House huddle between the President and top lieutenants , the Defense Department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North Viet Nam . </s>
<s> `` In view of the present situation in Laos '' , said the Pentagon's announcement , `` we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific '' . </s>
<s> Cutting short a holiday at Hong Kong , the aircraft carriers Lexington and Bennington steamed off into the South China Sea , accompanied by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships loaded with marines . </s>
<s> On the U.S.'s island base of Okinawa , Task Force 116 , made up of Army , Navy , Marine and Air Force units , got braced to move southward on signal . </s>
<s> But by week's end the Laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see foreign news ) , and the U.S. was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-Western -- government might be best for Laos . </s>
<s> French & Indians . </s>
<s> There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts . </s>
<s> Political , economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world to fight a war -- and they were probably right . </s>
<s> `` It would be like fighting the French and Indian War all over again '' , said one military man . </s>
<s> But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground ? ? </s>
<s> At Geneva in 1954 , to get the war in Indo-China settled , the British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state , North Viet Nam -- which then , predictably , became a base for Communist operations against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos . </s>
<s> The late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the West . </s>
<s> He began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of Aj . </s>
<s> `` The important thing from now on '' , he said , `` is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout Southeast Asia '' . </s>
<s> Russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of Havana , Russian intrigue in the Congo , and Russian arms drops in Laos ( using the same Ilyushin transports that were used to carry Communist agents to the Congo ) made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time . </s>
<s> Soviet Premier Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President-elect Kennedy , and got a cool acknowledgment in reply . </s>
<s> Considering the state of the whole world , the cold war's three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous ; ; </s>
<s> but , in Senator Gore's words , it was `` not a very encouraging '' situation that would confront John F. Kennedy on Inauguration Day . </s>
<s> The Congress </s>
<s> turmoil in the House </s>
<s> As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week , liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor . </s>
<s> The liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group ) had fought the committee before , and had always lost . </s>
<s> This time , they were much better prepared and organized , and the political climate was favorable . </s>
<s> They had the unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy , whose own legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneck . </s>
<s> And counting noses , they seemed to have the votes to work their will . </s>
<s> Deadly deadlock . </s>
<s> There were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee : 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely Mississippi's 14-term William Meyers Colmer ( pronounced Calmer ) . </s>
<s> Caucusing , the liberals decided to go after Colmer , which actually was the more drastic course , since seniority in the House is next to godliness . </s>
<s> A dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , Colmer looks younger than his 70 years , has gradually swung from a moderate , internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative . </s>
<s> He is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happens to benefit his Gulf Coast constituents . </s>
<s> He is , of course , a segregationist , but he says he has never made an `` anti-Negro '' speech . </s>
<s> For 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the Rules Committee . </s>
<s> There his vote , along with those of Chairman Howard Smith , the courtly Virginia judge , and the four Republican members , could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out , Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ) . </s>
<s> Equal treatment . </s>
<s> There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster : he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi . </s>
<s> Reprisals are not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons . </s>
<s> In 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry Truman , and in 1957 , after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow Democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage . </s>
<s> ( In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week , Judge Smith threatened reprisal against Powell . </s>
<s> Said he : `` We will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here '' . </s>
<s> ) But Speaker Sam Rayburn , after huddling in Palm Beach with President-elect Kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective . </s>
<s> In a tense , closed-door session with Judge Smith , Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise : to add three new members to the Rules Committee ( two Democrats , including one Southerner , and one Republican ) . </s>
<s> Smith flatly rejected the offer , and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels . </s>
<s> The next morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and broke the news : he would lead the fight to oust Colmer , whom he is said to regard as `` an inferior man '' . </s>
<s> News of Rayburn's commitment soon leaked out . </s>
<s> When Missouri's Clarence Cannon got the word , he turned purple . </s>
<s> `` Unconscionable '' ! ! </s>
<s> He shouted , and rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object : `` A dangerous precedent '' ! ! </s>
<s> Cannon , a powerful , conservative man , brought welcome support to the Smith-Colmer forces : as chairman of the Appropriations Committee , he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects . </s>
<s> Sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge Smith ally , Georgia's Carl Vinson , chairman of the Armed Services Committee . </s>
<s> Threat of war . </s>
<s> As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that Judge Smith could lose . </s>
<s> His highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member Democratic caucus . </s>
<s> The liberals , smelling blood , were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes -- in the Democratic Committee on Committees , in the full party caucus , and on the floor of the House -- before they could oust Colmer . </s>
<s> ( One big question : If Colmer was to be purged , what should the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported the maverick electors ? ? </s>
<s> ) In all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash . </s>
<s> But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war . </s>
<s> If the Southerners were sufficiently aroused , they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships , leaving Sam Rayburn leading a truncated , unworkable party . </s>
<s> With that possibility in mind , Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees , and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise . </s>
<s> `` Here are two old men , mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone '' , said a House Democratic leader . </s>
<s> `` One wants a little more power , and the other doesn't want to give up any '' . </s>
<s> Battle in the senate </s>
<s> The Senate launched the 87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a Capitol guide's speech . </s>
<s> Question at issue : How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ? ? </s>
<s> A wide-ranging , bipartisan force -- from Minnesota's Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts' Republican Leverett Saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills . </s>
<s> New Mexico's Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate's notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and voting to cut off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds . </s>
<s> Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of Senators . </s>
<s> Georgia's Dick Russell objected politely , and the battle was joined . </s>
<s> Privately , the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage . </s>
<s> Privately , they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon . </s>
<s> In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress , and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not binding . </s>
<s> Armed with the Nixon opinion , the Senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week . </s>
<s> Hopefully , the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all . </s>
<s> Republicans </s>
<s> last act </s>
<s> Since Election Day , Vice President Richard Nixon had virtually retired -- by his own wish -- from public view . </s>
<s> But with the convening of the new Congress , he was the public man again , presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy's Inauguration . </s>
<s> One day last week , Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote , and then to make `` sufficient declaration '' of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election . </s>
<s> Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required `` sufficient declaration '' . </s>
<s> `` This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated '' , he said . </s>
<s> The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . </s>
<s> Gary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap . </s>
<s> Arnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief . </s>
<s> `` Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you '' , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament . </s>
<s> And that is just what happened on the last few holes . </s>
<s> The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer . </s>
<s> Player was the first to feel its teeth . </s>
<s> After playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , Player's game rapidly fell to pieces . </s>
<s> He bogeyed the 10th . </s>
<s> After a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th . </s>
<s> He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 . </s>
<s> As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , Player was almost in tears . </s>
<s> He could read on the nearby scoreboard that Palmer , by then playing the 15th hole , was leading him by a stroke . </s>
<s> Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player , and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes . </s>
<s> Now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf . </s>
<s> When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole , he seemed to have the championship won . </s>
<s> But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression . </s>
<s> In trying to hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a TV tower . </s>
<s> Afterwards , Palmer told Charlie Coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast . </s>
<s> He did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out , giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lost . </s>
<s> When the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feet . </s>
<s> Palmer was now putting merely for a tie , and Player , who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment , stared in amazement when Palmer missed the putt . </s>
<s> Palmer's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with Coe . </s>
<s> The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur , who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years , refused to let the Masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69 . </s>
<s> End at seven </s>
<s> Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place . </s>
<s> As evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69 . </s>
<s> His three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by Bill Collins , the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long . </s>
<s> But Palmer knew , as did everybody else at Augusta , that his streak was about to be broken . </s>
<s> Half an hour after he finished his round , Player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of Palmer . </s>
<s> More than a streak had ended . </s>
<s> Long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player . </s>
<s> Unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case . </s>
<s> When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering prestige . </s>
<s> As if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments . </s>
<s> Player won only one . </s>
<s> But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago , Player was leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere . </s>
<s> On the final round at Pensacola , the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at the time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come . </s>
<s> On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won it . </s>
<s> But whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour . </s>
<s> Player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer . </s>
<s> He outplayed Palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71 . </s>
<s> Thereafter , until the Masters , Player gradually increased his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at Miami . </s>
<s> When they reached Augusta last week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date . </s>
<s> Instant rivalry </s>
<s> On Thursday , the first day of the Masters , the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly . </s>
<s> It was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National course . </s>
<s> The usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences . </s>
<s> Palmer's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with Bob Rosburg . </s>
<s> But Player was only one stroke back , with a 69 . </s>
<s> Even so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between Palmer and Player . </s>
<s> A lot of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70 ; ; </s>
<s> or Ken Venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better ; ; </s>
<s> or Rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries ; ; </s>
<s> or even old Byron Nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf . </s>
<s> ( On Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe . </s>
<s> ) </s>
<s> On Friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus . </s>
<s> Rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good day . </s>
<s> As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender . </s>
<s> Player began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th . </s>
<s> On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament . </s>
<s> He birdied the 13th , the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 . </s>
<s> Starting half an hour behind Player in company with British Open Champion Kel Nagle , Palmer birdied the 2nd , the 9th , the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 . </s>
<s> The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph . </s>
<s> At one point late in the day , when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole . </s>
<s> Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply . </s>
<s> The boldness of champions </s>
<s> Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course . </s>
<s> It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence . </s>
<s> The bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions . </s>
<s> Bob Jones played that way . </s>
<s> Byron Nelson did , Hogan did . </s>
<s> And last week at the Masters Palmer and Player did . </s>
<s> As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest , it was Player's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead . </s>
<s> This day Palmer had started first . </s>
<s> As Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day . </s>
<s> Player immediately proceeded to follow suit . </s>
<s> In fact , he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes . </s>
<s> But Player's real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards . </s>
<s> He hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways . </s>
<s> Having hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out . </s>
<s> Player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gambling . </s>
<s> The latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green . </s>
<s> `` I was hitting the ball well '' , Player said later , `` and I felt strong . </s>
<s> When you're playing like that you'd better attack '' . </s>
<s> Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget . </s>
<s> It struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge . </s>
<s> From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 . </s>
<s> Palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troubles . </s>
<s> They started on the 4th hole , a 220-yard par-3 . </s>
<s> On this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days . </s>
<s> At the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green . </s>
<s> His bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par . </s>
<s> Starting the second nine , Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it . </s>
<s> When Mickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime . </s>
<s> When Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe . </s>
<s> But when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there '' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous . </s>
<s> This is Baseball 1961 . </s>
<s> This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous . </s>
<s> It is the year when ( 1 ) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs ; ; </s>
<s> ( 2 ) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game ; ; </s>
<s> ( 3 ) the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them ; ; </s>
<s> and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter . </s>
<s> Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal . </s>
<s> Experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion . </s>
<s> Whatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run division . </s>
<s> Of all the records in peril , one stands apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardy . </s>
<s> This , of course , is baseball's most remarkable mark : The 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , George Herman ( Babe ) Ruth of the Yankees . </s>
<s> Since 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at Babe Ruth's record and each , in turn , has been thwarted . </s>
<s> What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth's amazing September surge . </s>
<s> In the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home runs , a closing spurt never matched . </s>
<s> Double threat : </s>
<s> Always , in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record , one man alone -- a Jimmy Foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a Hank Greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a Hack Wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) -- made the bid . </s>
<s> But now , for the first time since Lou Gehrig ( with 47 home runs ) spurred Ruth on in 1927 , two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60 . </s>
<s> Their names are Mantle and Maris , their team is the Yankees , and their threat is real . </s>
<s> After 108 games in 1927 , Ruth had 35 home runs . </s>
<s> After 108 games in 1961 , Mickey Mantle has 43 , Roger Maris 41 . </s>
<s> Extend Mantle's and Maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games , and , mathematically , each will hit more than 60 home runs . </s>
<s> This is the great edge the two Yankees have going for them . </s>
<s> To better Ruth's mark , neither needs a spectacular September flourish . </s>
<s> All Mantle needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September , and he will establish a new record . </s>
<s> In Ruth's day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 games . </s>
<s> Baseball commissioner Ford Frick has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games . </s>
<s> ) </s>
<s> `` Even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation '' , insists Hank Greenberg , now vice-president of the Chicago White Sox . </s>
<s> `` It has to be easier with two of them . </s>
<s> How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle '' ? ? </s>
<s> Roommates : </s>
<s> Neither Mantle nor Maris , understandably , will predict 60 home runs for himself . </s>
<s> Although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote : `` The important thing is to win the pennant '' . </s>
<s> But one thing is for certain : There is no dissension between Mantle , the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957 , and Maris , the MVP in 1960 . </s>
<s> Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ( `` I hope Roger hits 80 '' , Mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ( `` and I hope I hit 81 '' ) . </s>
<s> The sluggers get along so well in fact , that with their families at home for the summer ( Mantle's in Dallas , Maris's in Kansas City ) , they are rooming together . </s>
<s> Mantle , Maris , and Bob Cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in Jamaica , Long Island , not far from New York International Airport . </s>
<s> The three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining room , living room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture . </s>
<s> Mantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom ; ; </s>
<s> Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room . </s>
<s> They divide up the household chores : Cerv does most of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , Mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible ) , and Maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium . </s>
<s> Mantle , Maris , and Cerv probably share one major-league record already : Among them , they have fifteen children -- eight for Cerv , four for Mantle , and three for Maris . </s>
<s> As roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , Mantle , 29 , who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago , and Maris , 26 , who came to the Yankees from Kansas City two years ago , have strikingly similar backgrounds . </s>
<s> Both were scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( Mantle in Commerce , Okla. , Maris in Fargo , N.D. ) ; ; </s>
<s> as halfbacks , both came close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma ( `` Sometimes in the minors '' , Maris recalls , `` I wished I had gone to Oklahoma '' ) . </s>
<s> To an extent , the two even look alike . </s>
<s> Both have blue eyes and short blond hair . </s>
<s> Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but Mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ) , looks bigger . </s>
<s> With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to order . </s>
<s> Maris purchases $100 suits from Simpson's in New York . </s>
<s> Mantle , more concerned with dress , buys his suits four at a time at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and pays as much as $250 each . </s>
<s> Light reading : </s>
<s> Neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , Henry Miller's `` Tropic of Cancer '' . </s>
<s> Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips . </s>
<s> Mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking . </s>
<s> `` What do you and Mickey talk about at home '' ? ? </s>
<s> A reporter asked Maris recently . </s>
<s> `` To tell you the truth '' , Maris said , `` Mickey don't talk much '' . </s>
<s> This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer . </s>
<s> What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are trying to be cooperative . </s>
<s> Of the two , Mantle is by nature the less outgoing , Maris the more outspoken . </s>
<s> But last week , when a reporter was standing near Mantle's locker , Mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote . </s>
<s> `` See that kid '' ? ? </s>
<s> He said , pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy . </s>
<s> `` That's ( Yogi ) Berra's . </s>
<s> I'll never forget one time I struck out three times , dropped a fly ball , and we lost the game . </s>
<s> I came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says : ' You stunk ' '' . </s>
<s> Maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen . </s>
<s> `` When I've made a dumb play '' , he says , `` I don't want to talk to anyone . </s>
<s> I'm angry '' . </s>
<s> By his own confession , Maris is an angry young man . </s>
<s> Benched at Tulsa in 1955 , he told manager Dutch Meyer : `` I can't play for you . </s>
<s> Send me where I can play '' . </s>
<s> ( Meyer sent him to Reading , Pa. . </s>
<s> ) Benched at Indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager Kerby Farrell : `` I'm not learning anything on the bench . </s>
<s> Play me '' . </s>
<s> ( Farrell did -- and Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series . </s>
<s> ) `` That's the way I am '' , he says . </s>
<s> `` I tell people what I think . </s>
<s> If you're a good ballplayer , you've got to get mad . </s>
<s> Give me a team of nine angry men and I'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of ten times '' . </s>
<s> Idols' idols : </s>
<s> One good indication of the two men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes . </s>
<s> Maris's was Ted Williams . </s>
<s> `` When I was a kid '' , Maris told a sportswriter last week , `` I used to follow Williams every day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not '' . </s>
<s> `` When you came up to the majors , did you seek out Williams for advice '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` Are you kidding '' ? ? </s>
<s> Said Maris . </s>
<s> `` You're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize '' . </s>
<s> Mantle's hero was Joe DiMaggio . </s>
<s> `` When Mickey went to the Yankees '' , says Mark Freeman , an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver , `` DiMaggio still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his . </s>

<s> Among all the Yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookies . </s>
<s> Neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else . </s>
<s> If laying ties on a railroad track , which he once did for $1 an hour , paid more than playing right field for the Yankees , Maris would lay ties on a railroad track . </s>

<s> Maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against Luis Aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the White Sox . </s>
<s> Both are good , daring fielders : Mantle covers more ground ; ; </s>

<s> G. David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe's best hotels , but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of Pittsburgh . </s>
<s> There the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collecting art . </s>
<s> Last week , in the German city of Dusseldorf , G. David Thompson was making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause . </s>
<s> On display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale . </s>
<s> Like Philadelphia's late Dr. Albert C. Barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( Time , Jan. 2 ) , Thompson , at 61 , is something of a legend in his own lifetime . </s>
<s> He made his fortune during World War 2 , when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom . </s>
<s> Even before he hit big money , he had begun buying modern paintings . </s>
<s> He gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best . </s>
<s> He was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away , and the Museum of Modern Art's Alfred Barr said of him : `` I have never mentioned a new artist that Thompson didn't know about '' . </s>
<s> He might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting . </s>
<s> He could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he was tough . </s>
<s> He bought up Cezannes , Braques , Matisses , Legers , a splendid Picasso series , more than 70 Giacometti sculptures . </s>
<s> He gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees in the world . </s>
<s> All these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone's Throw , outside Pittsburgh , and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them . </s>
<s> Two years ago Thompson offered his collection to the city . </s>
<s> But he insisted that it be housed in a special museum . </s>
<s> Pittsburgh turned him down , just as Pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years . </s>
<s> He went then to a 40-year-old Basel art dealer named Ernst Beyeler , with whom he had long been trading pictures . </s>
<s> Last year Beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of Klees to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia , which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built . </s>
<s> Last week most of the other prizes , once offered to Pittsburgh , went on the block . </s>
<s> At the opening of the Dusseldorf show , Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time . </s>
<s> In fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them . </s>
<s> Some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town . </s>
<s> Thompson himself said : `` I want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures '' . </s>
<s> Break in Georgia </s>
<s> The University of Georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color . </s>
<s> But in all its 175 years , not a single Negro student has entered its classrooms . </s>
<s> Last week Federal District Judge William A. Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a `` qualified '' Negro boy and girl . </s>
<s> Their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate school , in Georgia -- and in Alabama , Mississippi and South Carolina as well . </s>
<s> For 18 months , Hamilton Holmes , 19 , and Charlayne Hunter , 18 , had tried to get into the university . </s>
<s> They graduated together from Atlanta's Turner High School , where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third . </s>
<s> The university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skins . </s>
<s> Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse ( Negro ) College , where he is a B student and star halfback . </s>
<s> Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State University . </s>
<s> Last fall , after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court , Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again . </s>
<s> Charlayne was `` tentatively '' admitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at Wayne State . </s>
<s> But Holmes was rejected again `` on the basis of his record and interview '' . </s>
<s> The evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for Holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation . </s>
<s> Holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution , or a `` beatnik parlor or teahouse '' . </s>
<s> No , said he , but officials still called him `` evasive '' . </s>
<s> They also said he lied in saying that he had never been `` arrested '' . </s>
<s> Their reason : Holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine , had his license suspended . </s>
<s> Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes . </s>
<s> The real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school . </s>
<s> Judge Bootle's decision : `` The two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color '' . </s>
<s> The state will appeal -- but few think it will actually try to close the university . </s>
<s> `` Surprised and pleased '' , Students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia this week . </s>
<s> Catch for Chicago </s>
<s> When the University of Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton submitted his resignation last March , a mighty talent hunt gripped the Midway . </s>
<s> Out went letters to 60,000 old grads , asking for suggestions . </s>
<s> Such academic statesmen as James B. Conant were consulted . </s>
<s> Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors , including Adlai Stevenson , Richard Nixon , and Harvard's Dean McGeorge Bundy . </s>
<s> The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator , but rather , as Trustee Chairman Glen A. Lloyd put it , `` a top scholar in his own right '' -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago . </s>
<s> Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's acting dean of the faculty : dynamic Geneticist George Wells Beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( Time , Cover , July 14 , 1958 ) . </s>
<s> It fell to Chancellor Kimpton , now a Standard Oil ( Indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins . </s>
<s> He threw out some of Hutchins' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2,100 , nearly doubled endowment to $139.3 million . </s>
<s> But though Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady Hutchins era . </s>
<s> At Caltech , Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology division since 1946 . </s>
<s> But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making . </s>
<s> Beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters ; ; </s>
<s> he avidly reads the Wall Street Journal , and took delight in driving a $250 model A Ford for 22 years , then selling it for $300 . </s>
<s> A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . </s>
<s> But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . </s>
<s> The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . </s>
<s> By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . </s>
<s> This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; </s>
<s> and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . </s>
<s> Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; </s>
<s> they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . </s>
<s> The population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters '' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects . </s>
<s> The religions of the people include Christianity , Mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism . </s>
<s> The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate . </s>
<s> The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars . </s>
<s> To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case ; ; </s>
<s> it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done , or failed to do , in the Congo since 1885 . </s>
<s> At first the Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property . </s>
<s> But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience . </s>
<s> The Belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism . </s>
<s> One definition of paternalism is `` The principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children '' . </s>
<s> The honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment . </s>
<s> Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child , if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant . </s>
<s> The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oil . </s>
<s> The colony was administered from Brussels , with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote . </s>
<s> The beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock . </s>
<s> In Inside Africa , John Gunther describes one of these , the Societe Generale , as `` the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the House of Morgan , Anaconda Copper , the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York , the Pennsylvania Railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the United States government as a heavy partner '' . </s>
<s> Had they been truly ruthless , the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion . </s>
<s> But they were not . </s>
<s> They provided a social security system which covered all their African employes ; ; </s>
<s> their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent ; ; </s>
<s> they put much effort into public housing . </s>
<s> They also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food . </s>
<s> But instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month , the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often . </s>
<s> Would not the children , if they received all their food on the first day of the month , eat it up immediately , and later go hungry ? ? </s>
<s> The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education . </s>
<s> During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the Congo . </s>
<s> But almost all the schools were primary . </s>
<s> The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte '' and `` le chien '' and write his name . </s>
<s> Some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many . </s>
<s> But they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college . </s>
<s> It was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together '' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science . </s>
<s> Indeed , the Belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest . </s>
<s> When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates . </s>
<s> Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? ? </s>
<s> In one large oversimplification , it might be said that the Belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping Africa . </s>
<s> They lacked time to prepare the Congo , as the British and French had prepared their colonies . </s>
<s> The Congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant ; ; </s>
<s> and in Brussels , street crowds shouted , `` Pas une goutte de sang ! ! </s>
<s> '' ( Not one drop of blood ! ! </s>
<s> ) . </s>
<s> The Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue ; ; </s>
<s> rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the mess . </s>
<s> It is hard to blame them for this . </s>
<s> Yet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless . </s>
<s> As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate . </s>
<s> There were four principal ones . </s>
<s> First , there were those Congolese ( among them Joseph Kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , Balkanizing it . </s>
<s> Second , there were those ( Moise Tshombe ) who favored near-Balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the states . </s>
<s> Third , there were those ( notably Patrice Lumumba ) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central government . </s>
<s> And fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up . </s>
<s> However , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting . </s>
<s> A final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration . </s>
<s> They had divided the Congo into six provinces -- Leopoldville , Kasai , Kivu , Katanga , Equator and Eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings . </s>
<s> Thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war . </s>
<s> The Belgian Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government : there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces . </s>
<s> Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations . </s>
<s> If internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army , the Force Publique , which had been trained and was still officered by white Belgians . </s>
<s> The president , Joseph Kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , Patrice Lumumba , a reasonable man . </s>
<s> Twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other . </s>
<s> Presently the well-armed members of the Force Publique -- many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting . </s>
<s> Terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country . </s>
<s> The Belgian government decided to act , and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo . </s>
<s> On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga , Moise Tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country . </s>
<s> Confusion became chaos ; ; </s>
<s> each succeeding day brought new acts of violence . </s>
<s> Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians , and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to oust them . </s>
<s> On July 14 the Security Council -- with France and Great Britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the U.N. into the Congo . </s>
<s> Vague in wording , it called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General `` to take the necessary steps to provide the ( Congolese ) Government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations , the national security forces may be able , in the opinion of the Government , to meet fully their tasks . </s>
<s> '' </s>
<s> Secretary-General Hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the U.N. troops sent into the Congo were to come from African , or at least nonwhite , nations -- certainly not from the U.S. , Russia , Great Britain or France . </s>
<s> He quickly called on Ghana , Tunisia , Morocco , Guinea and Mali , which dispatched troops within hours . </s>
<s> Ultimately the U.N. army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19,000 , including about 5,000 from India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden , who were the only whites . </s>
<s> It took the U.N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo . </s>
<s> The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N. efforts . </s>
<s> The wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the U.N. to get out of the Congo along with the Belgians , and appealed to Russia for help . </s>
<s> ( However , there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist . </s>
<s> Before appealing to the U.N. or to Russia , he first appealed to the U.S. for military help , and was rejected . </s>
<s> ) Lumumba further complicated the U.N.'s mission by initiating small `` wars '' with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which , under Albert Kalonji , wanted to secede as well . </s>
<s> Meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo , sending Lumumba equipment for his `` wars '' , dispatching `` technicians '' and even threatening , on occasion , to intervene openly . </s>
<s> But by the end of the three-month period , in October 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the Congo . </s>
<s> President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and fired him . </s>
<s> Lumumba fired Kasavubu . </s>
<s> Control of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of Joseph Mobutu , chief of staff of the Congolese army . </s>
<s> Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U.N. headquarters in New York . </s>
<s> The Belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the Congo as well , withdrawing all of their uniformed troops . </s>
<s> But they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers '' or `` mercenaries '' , who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga , the seceded province which , according to Tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country . </s>
<s> From October 1960 to February 1961 , the U.N. forces in the Congo took little action . </s>
<s> There was no directive for it -- the Security Council's resolution had not mentioned political matters , and in any case the United Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or Balkanize it . </s>
<s> During the five-month lull , civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the Congo . </s>
<s> In February the murder of Patrice Lumumba , who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe , again stirred the U.N. to action . </s>
<s> On Feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last resort '' . </s>
<s> Although the resolution might have been far more specific , it was considerably tougher than the earlier one . </s>
<s> It also urged that the U.N. eject , and prevent the return of , all Belgian and other foreign military and political advisers ; ; </s>
<s> ordered an investigation of Lumumba's death ; ; </s>
<s> urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the reorganization of the army . </s>
<s> The presidency : talking and listening </s>
<s> Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . </s>
<s> High up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . </s>
<s> On this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . </s>
<s> Ideally , the President would like the French to agree on a `` status quo ante '' on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . </s>
<s> To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . </s>
<s> The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . </s>
<s> The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable . </s>
<s> Through Ladgham , Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; ; </s>
<s> and one U.S. official said : `` The key question now is which side picks up the phone first '' . </s>
<s> On the Latin American front , the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council ( which the President himself had originally hoped to attend ) . </s>
<s> Main purpose of the meeting : To discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress . </s>
<s> And that was not all . </s>
<s> In conferences with Nationalist China's dapper , diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng , Mr. Kennedy assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that the U.S. is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United Nations . </s>
<s> Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer Mongolia ; ; </s>
<s> however the President , who would like to woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow , would promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U.S. if Outer Mongolia's admission comes to a vote . </s>
<s> The President also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aid . </s>
<s> To Africa , he sent his most trusted adviser , his brother , Attorney General Robert Kennedy , on a good-will mission to the Ivory Coast . </s>
<s> All week long the President clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs ; ; </s>
<s> in effect , he was practicing what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared : `` We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with reason '' . </s>
<s> Crime : ' skyjacked ' </s>
<s> From International Airport in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston , as the great four-jet Boeing 707 flies , is a routine five hours and 25 minutes , including stopovers at Phoenix , El Paso , and San Antonio . </s>

<s> the man put his at the head of Capt. Byron D. Rickards . </s>
<s> To Rickards , a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air , it was an old story : His plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 , when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa . </s>
<s> But last week's pirates , like the Cuban-American who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra ( Newsweek , Aug. 7 ) , wanted to go to Havana . </s>
<s> Stalling : </s>
<s> `` Tell your company there are four of us here with guns '' , the elder man told Rickards . </s>
<s> The pilot radioed El Paso International Airport with just that message . </s>
<s> But , he told the `` skyjackers '' , the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach Havana ; ; </s>
<s> they would have to refuel at El Paso . </s>
<s> Most passengers didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground . </s>
<s> Jerry McCauley of Sacramento , Calif. , one of some twenty Air Force recruits on board , awoke from a nap in confusion . </s>
<s> `` The old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to Cuba '' , McCauley said , `` and like a nut I raised my hand . </s>
<s> I thought he was the Air Force recruiter '' . </s>
<s> What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crew . </s>
<s> They chose four : Jack Casey , who works for Continental Airlines in Houston ; ; </s>
<s> Fred Mullen from Mercer Island , Wash. ; ; </s>
<s> Pfc. Truman Cleveland of St. Augustine . </s>
<s> Fla. , and Leonard Gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the U.S. Immigration Service Border Patrol . </s>
<s> Everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4:18 a.m. . </s>
<s> They found a large welcoming group -- El Paso policemen , Border Patrol , sheriff's deputies , and FBI men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns . </s>
<s> Other FBI men , talking with the pilot from the tower , conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to Havana . </s>
<s> The ground crew , which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes , took fully three hours . </s>
<s> Still more time was consumed while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert Six , tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller-driven Douglas Aj . </s>
<s> Actually , the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane ; ; </s>
<s> they had orders to that effect straight from President Kennedy , who thought at first , as did most others , that it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel Castro who had taken over the 707 . </s>
<s> Mr. Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , kept in touch throughout by telephone . </s>
<s> At one time , while still under the impression that he was dealing with a Cuban plot , the President talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with Cuba . </s>
<s> As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains , police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment . </s>
<s> From the luggage , they learned that the two air pirates , far from being Cubans , were native Americans , subsequently identified as Leon Bearden , 50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge , Ariz. , and his son , Cody , 16 , a high-school junior . </s>
<s> Tension </s>
<s> The heat and strain began to tell on the Beardens . </s>
<s> The father , by accident or perhaps to show , as he said , `` we mean business '' , took the and fired a slug between the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons . </s>
<s> At 7:30 a.m. , more than three hours after landing , the Beardens gave an ultimatum : </s>
<s> Take off or see the hostages killed . </s>
<s> The tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a.m. , and Captain Rickards began taxiing toward the runway . </s>
<s> Several police cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing away at the tires of the big jet . </s>
<s> The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines ; ; </s>
<s> the plane slowed to a halt . </s>
<s> Ambulances , baggage trucks , and cars surrounded it . </s>
<s> The day wore on . </s>
<s> At 12:50 p.m. a ramp was rolled up to the plane . </s>
<s> A few minutes later , FBI agent Francis Crosby , talking fast , eased up the ramp to the plane , unarmed . </s>
<s> While Crosby distracted the Beardens , stewardesses Carnegey and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door . </s>
<s> So did hostages Casey , Cleveland , and Mullen . </s>
<s> That left only the four crew members , Crosby , and Border Patrolman Gilman , all unarmed , with the Beardens . </s>
<s> The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip pocket . </s>
<s> Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance . </s>
<s> He caught officer Simmons' eye , nodded toward young Bearden , and -- `` I swung my right as hard as I could . </s>
<s> Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy and it was all over '' . </s>
<s> Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 p.m. , the Beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines . </s>
<s> ( Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro , and live high in Cuba . </s>

<s> Congress : more muscle </s>
<s> Taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of the nation . </s>
<s> The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in U.S. history . </s>
<s> With the money all but in hand , however , the Administration indicated that , instead of the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested , the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000 . </s>
<s> The `` hold-back '' , as Pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudently . </s>
<s> In all , the Senate signed a check for $46.7 billion , which not only included the extra $3.5 billion requested the week before by President Kennedy , but tacked on $754 million more than the President had asked for . </s>
<s> ( The Senate , on its own , decided to provide additional B-52 and other long-range bombers for the Strategic Air Command . </s>
<s> ) The House , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent call for more , was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order . </s>
<s> In other areas , Congressional action last week included : </s>
<s> The Senate ( by voice vote ) and the House ( by 224-170 ) passed and sent to the White House the compromise farm bill which the President is expected to sign , not too unhappily . </s>
<s> The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's health , welfare , and labor activities . </s>
<s> Debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend . </s>
<s> White House legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact . </s>
<s> Food : stew a la Mulligatawny </s>
<s> Most members of the U.S. Senate , because they are human , like to eat as high on the hog as they can . </s>
<s> But , because they are politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter . </s>
<s> As a result , ever since 1851 when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it . </s>
<s> Over the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-American course . </s>
<s> Individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from Michigan , soft-shell crabs from Maryland , oysters from Washington , grapefruit from Florida . </s>
<s> But plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late Sen. Fred Dubois of Idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the Senate's stomach was in the right place . </s>
<s> In a daring stroke , the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year French-born maitre d'hotel . </s>
<s> Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes . </s>
<s> Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward . </s>
<s> Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues . </s>
<s> Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative . </s>
<s> Things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds . </s>
<s> Traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing . </s>
<s> That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates . </s>
<s> As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments . </s>
<s> Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds . </s>
<s> Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21 , according to Standard & Poor's average . </s>
<s> On balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then . </s>
<s> However , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend . </s>
<s> On these bonds , price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declines . </s>
<s> Tax-free returns . </s>
<s> Investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds . </s>
<s> You find the evidence of that in the chart on this page . </s>
<s> Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent , or very close to that . </s>
<s> And this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds . </s>
<s> That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds . </s>
<s> It's not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury bonds . </s>
<s> For investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high . </s>
<s> It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed , or for a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income . </s>
<s> Swelling traffic . </s>
<s> A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in February or March -- shows what is happening . </s>
<s> The report is based on a survey by Blyth & Company , investment bankers . </s>
<s> Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period . </s>
<s> And there is the bright note : The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession . </s>
<s> Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter . </s>
<s> Indication : The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward . </s>
<s> Look , for example , at the Ohio Turnpike . </s>
<s> Traffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February , as compared with those same months in 1960 . </s>
<s> Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs . </s>
<s> As a result , the road's net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds . </s>
<s> That was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months . </s>
<s> That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts Turnpike . </s>
<s> Operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in March . </s>
<s> Costs were held down , despite a bitter winter . </s>
<s> For the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding period . </s>
<s> The road's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston . </s>
<s> Slow successes . </s>
<s> Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do . </s>
<s> The 187-mile Illinois State Toll Highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until December , 1958 . </s>
<s> In the 12 months ended in February , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves . </s>
<s> In the 12 months ended in February , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest . </s>
<s> That improvement is continuing . </s>
<s> In the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 . </s>
<s> Success , for many turnpikes , has come hard . </s>
<s> Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates . </s>
<s> In these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways . </s>
<s> Many rate increases already have been put into effect . </s>
<s> Higher tolls are planned for July 1 , 1961 , on the Richmond-Petersburg , Va. , Turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study . </s>
<s> Easier access . </s>
<s> Progress is being made , too , in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes . </s>
<s> The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration . </s>
<s> Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28 , 1961 . </s>
<s> Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas City , Kans. , and Kansas City , Mo. . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years . </s>
<s> For some roads , troubles . </s>
<s> Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals . </s>
<s> Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike . </s>
<s> If nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 . </s>
<s> West Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same . </s>
<s> These , however , are exceptions . </s>
<s> The typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement . </s>
<s> It's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full . </s>
<s> Already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins . </s>
<s> Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point . </s>
<s> A top American official , after a look at Europe's factories , thinks the U.S. is in a `` very serious situation '' competitively . </s>
<s> Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on May 10 toured plants of two of Italy's biggest companies -- Fiat , the auto producer , and Olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating machines . </s>
<s> Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows -- </s>
<s> `` Follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant , and you learn this : </s>
<s> `` One , modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the Marshall Plan -- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a day . </s>
<s> About half of these are exported . </s>
<s> `` Two , wage costs are a fraction of the U.S. costs . </s>
<s> A skilled worker on the assembly line , for example , earns $37 a week . </s>
<s> `` Three , labor troubles are infrequent . </s>
<s> Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years . </s>
<s> `` Said Secretary Hodges : ' It's a tough combination for the U.S. to face . </s>
<s> `` Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges . </s>
<s> Olivetti took over Underwood , the U.S. typewriter maker , in late 1959 . </s>
<s> Within a year , without reducing wages , Underwood's production costs were cut one third , prices were slashed . </s>
<s> The result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled . </s>
<s> `` The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout , modern machinery . </s>
<s> The firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious . </s>
<s> `` Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U.S. . </s>
<s> The inflow of foreign capital would help the U.S. balance of payments . </s>
<s> `` Hodges predicted : ' I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the U.S. . </s>
<s> There are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas ' '' . </s>
<s> Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports . </s>
<s> The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines . </s>
<s> Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these : </s>
<s> An international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy . </s>
<s> Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting . </s>
<s> The U.S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years . </s>
<s> Point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet . </s>
<s> If they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would . </s>
<s> Idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible . </s>
<s> At the same time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries . </s>
<s> Japan , since 1957 , has been `` voluntarily '' curbing exports of textiles to the U.S. . </s>
<s> Hong Kong , India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the `` Lancashire Pact '' . </s>
<s> None of these countries is happy with these arrangements . </s>
<s> The Japanese want to increase exports to the U.S. While they have been curbing shipments , they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big U.S. market . </s>
<s> Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain , while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly . </s>
<s> The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasons . </s>
<s> The Kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that `` dumping '' practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas . </s>
<s> Gradual , controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what President Kennedy wants . </s>
<s> This may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products . </s>
<s> It's an important clue to Washington thinking . </s>
<s> Note , too , that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry . </s>
<s> `` Get competitive or get out '' . </s>
<s> In veiled terms , that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry . </s>
<s> The Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn't seem feasible . </s>
<s> Special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed . </s>
<s> Government research will look into new products and methods . </s>
<s> Import quotas aren't ruled out where the national interest is involved . </s>
<s> But the Kennedy Administration doesn't favor import quotas . </s>
<s> Rather , they are impressed with the British Government's success in forcing -- and helping -- the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products . </s>
<s> What's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries . </s>
<s> Among the highest-paid workers in the world are U.S. coal miners . </s>
<s> Yet U.S. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water . </s>
<s> Steel Company of Wales , a British steelmaker , wants to bring in Virginia coal , cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets . </s>
<s> Virginia coal , delivered by ship in Wales , will be about $2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines . </s>
<s> U.S. coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freight . </s>
<s> Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting , narrow and very deep . </s>
<s> Productivity of U.S. miners is twice that of the British . </s>
<s> Welsh coal miners , Communist-led , are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American coal . </s>
<s> They threaten to strike . </s>
<s> The British Government will have to decide whether to let U.S. coal in . </s>
<s> The British coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can't sell . </s>
<s> Every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` I'm sorry , but we don't have that book . </s>
<s> There wouldn't be much demand for it , I'm afraid '' . </s>
<s> Behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . </s>
<s> What to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? </s>
<s> What to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? </s>
<s> Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . </s>
<s> A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually , which includes the librarian's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest city . </s>
<s> The plight of a small community library is proportionately worse . </s>
<s> Confronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds . </s>
<s> In some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis . </s>
<s> New York State has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow . </s>
<s> Because it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the New York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works . </s>
<s> At one extreme are the systems of upper New York State , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated area . </s>
<s> At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library System , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve . </s>
<s> Both these types , and those in between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state . </s>
<s> It was a step in the right direction , but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today . </s>
<s> Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts . </s>
<s> An earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they saw fit . </s>
<s> Some library boards are wary of the plan . </s>
<s> A large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great . </s>
<s> A small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board . </s>
<s> Within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserved . </s>
<s> The local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system . </s>
<s> All services are given without cost to members . </s>
<s> So obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State now has access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op . </s>
<s> To set up a co-operative library system , the law requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organized around it . </s>
<s> The collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collection . </s>
<s> Each system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency . </s>
<s> The basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served , and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita , if a library spends a certain number of dollars . </s>
<s> In Nassau County , for example , the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City , the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons , a figure that has doubled since 1950 . </s>
<s> This system , by virtue of its variety and size , offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation . </s>
<s> The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area . </s>
<s> The need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate to satisfy everyday needs , could afford . </s>
<s> Nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100,000 volumes by 1965 . </s>
<s> The major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers . </s>
<s> Basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local libraries . </s>
<s> On microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as well as bound volumes of important periodicals . </s>
<s> The entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans . </s>
<s> Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day . </s>
<s> It is connected by teletype with the State Library in Albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide . </s>
<s> The books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries . </s>
<s> Each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build upon . </s>
<s> East Meadow has philosophy , psychology , and religion ; ; </s>
<s> Freeport houses social science , pure science , and language ; ; </s>
<s> history , biography , and education are centered in Hempstead ; ; </s>
<s> Levittown has applied science , business , and literature ; ; </s>
<s> while Hewlett-Woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languages . </s>
<s> The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant , and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service . </s>
<s> This kind of cooperation is not wholly new , of course . </s>
<s> Public libraries in Nassau County have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis . </s>
<s> Local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library . </s>
<s> The system passes on these savings to its members . </s>
<s> Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing . </s>
<s> Books are not the only resource of the system . </s>
<s> Schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary , art , and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs , and to organizations in member communities . </s>
<s> The most recent film catalogue , available at each library , lists 110 titles presently in the collection , any of which may be borrowed without charge . </s>
<s> This catalogue lists separately films suitable for children , young adults , or adults , although some classics cut across age groups , such as `` Nanook Of The North '' , `` The Emperor's Nightingale '' , and `` The Red Balloon '' . </s>
<s> Workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries , teaching them the effective use of film as a library service . </s>
<s> The system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together ; ; </s>
<s> consequently an experienced children's librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities , cooperating with the children's librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences , workshops , and frequent visits . </s>
<s> Headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center , to provide better methods of purchasing and selection . </s>
<s> Sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups . </s>
<s> Story hours , pre-school programs , activities with community agencies , and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children's consultant . </s>
<s> Headquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days , threatening to expand beyond its boundaries . </s>
<s> In addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children's program , headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county ; ; </s>
<s> it prepares cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional material ) for use in member libraries ; ; </s>
<s> it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used ; ; </s>
<s> and it publishes Sum And Substance , a monthly newsletter , which reports the system's activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries . </s>
<s> The system itself is governed by a board of trustees , geographically representing its membership . </s>
<s> In Nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools , and on adult education in general . </s>
<s> Librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results today . </s>
<s> Library use is multiplying daily , and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned Americans , the teen-agers . </s>
<s> To them especially the librarians , with the help of co-ops , hope they will never have to say , `` I'm sorry , we don't have that book '' . </s>
<s> Today , more than ever before , the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned . </s>
<s> The great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western world . </s>
<s> The need for lifetime reading is apparent . </s>
<s> Education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope with the dangers that threaten our society . </s>
<s> The desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life . </s>
<s> We cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read ; ; </s>
<s> if we are not discriminating in our reading ; ; </s>
<s> if we do not know how to use what we do read . </s>
<s> We must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word . </s>
<s> A fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries . </s>
<s> Although progress has been made in America's system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed America . </s>
<s> The problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expand . </s>
<s> The inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition . </s>
<s> There are , for example , approximately 25,000,000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000 with inadequate service . </s>
<s> In college libraries , 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1,509 institutions surveyed last year by the U.S. Office of Education . </s>
<s> And over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all . </s>
<s> In every aspect of service -- to the public , to children in schools , to colleges and universities -- the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services . </s>
<s> Only public understanding and support can provide that service . </s>
<s> This is one of the main reasons for National Library Week , April 16-22 , and for its theme : `` For a richer , fuller life , read '' ! ! </s>
