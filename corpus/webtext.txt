<s> Lovely delicate , fragrant Rhone wine . </s>
<s> Polished leather and strawberries . </s>
<s> Perhaps a bit dilute , but good for drinking now . </s>
<s> *** Liquorice , cherry fruit . </s>
<s> Simple and coarse at the finish . </s>
<s> ** Thin and completely uninspiring . </s>
<s> * Rough . </s>
<s> No Stars Big , fat , textured Chardonnay - nuts and butterscotch . </s>
<s> A slightly odd metallic / cardboard finish , but probably *** A blind tasting , other than the fizz , which included five vintages of Cote Rotie Brune et Blonde from Guigal . </s>
<s> Surprisingly young feeling and drinking well , but without any great complexity . </s>
<s> A good *** Charming , violet - fragranced nose . </s>
<s> Classic Guigal Cote Rotie . </s>
<s> **** Good grip and a touch of rusticity on the length . </s>
<s> VA showing through . </s>
<s> On the downhill slope . </s>
<s> Just **** Just about holding together - drying out a touch at the finish . </s>
<s> Not as good as I thought this would be . </s>
<s> A good *** In your face wine - rather obvious and simple ( although some structure did begin to show through ). </s>
<s> *** Some volatility , and all over the place on the nose and palate . </s>
<s> It did come together more with time . </s>
<s> *** Gummy nose , merlot - style sweetness . </s>
<s> Good wine , but not in a style I was expecting . </s>
<s> **** Hot on the palate , but good balance with some maturity . </s>
<s> *** This has a Rhonish air to it , feels quite young , but it is also a bit simple . </s>
<s> *** Liquorice . </s>
<s> Fruit beginning to dry out . </s>
<s> ** Good sweetly fragranced wine . </s>
<s> Drink now . </s>
<s> Top *** A big nose of public swimming pools - bizarre ( some might say funky ). </s>
<s> * </s>
<s> Very vinous - Burgundy with bubbles , to some extent and so a bit much in some ways . </s>
<s> I suspect it needs time to mellow - it will be interesting to see how this develops ( this bottle was disgorged only last year ). </s>
<s> If all goes well ***(*) All quite refined and delicate , appley pinot fruit , autolytic flavours . </s>
<s> Another fairly recent disgorgement after 4 years in cellars ( credit the producer for an excellent back label ), it just seems a bit lacking in intensity despite the obvious quality . </s>
<s> Perhaps this will develop but for now a good *** Good fruit - nice acidity . </s>
<s> Pretty intense although it seems quite evolved for a young wine - I fear it may go down the Ozzy route of rather early flabby kerosene flavours . </s>
<s> Top ** Curiously Sauvignon - like - quite rich . </s>
<s> Odd balance - people were saying this is a vineyard Huet took on and then abandoned . </s>
<s> Good wine but it doesn ' t seem to have the class of their major wines . </s>
<s> A low **(*) Pretty nice . </s>
<s> Clean , rich , yet decently taught . </s>
<s> A credit to the appelation . </s>
<s> Bare *** A weak cork and a rather oxidised bottle - one sips for a while but then abandons it . </s>
<s> I have had much better . </s>
<s> Not Rated Very light and delicate - decent but a bit attenuated . </s>
<s> I have had better bottles . </s>
<s> *** Dry , savoury , quite succulent . </s>
<s> Pleasantly high - toned , nervy , and a bit awkward . </s>
<s> A wine with a sense of place and hence enjoyable . </s>
<s> *** Curiously quiet , but concentration and fruit quality are all there . </s>
<s> Maybe just in a dull phase - perhaps it would have shown better decanted and allowed a little air . </s>
<s> *** Leafy , dry , decent balance . </s>
<s> Good wine but I doubt it ' s going anywhere much . </s>
<s> Pleasant , and perhaps it would reward further attention . </s>
<s> ** Quite baked , decent concentration - slightly hot finish . </s>
<s> I recall having had better from this producer . </s>
<s> ** Refined , smooth sweet ( to a controlled extent ) - very drinkable . </s>
<s> Forward fruit but with the balance to hold it - the best of the New World reds , to my palate . </s>
<s> Top *** Huge monster - alcohol gets up my a nose and in my throat rather . </s>
<s> I find this a bit much . </s>
<s> Returning to it later it seemed to have mellowed quite a bit and to be a substantial wine in its way , although I find it hard to decide about it . </s>
<s> Many will admire this , and I may too given time to consider it - I had it eight and a half years ago and was impressed . </s>
<s> I think I ' ll reserve judgement for now . </s>
<s> Not Rated A bit anonymous in some ways , but very nicely poised fairly concentrated dessert wine - from the South of France somewhere , I guess . </s>
<s> I suspect this would repay more attention and on that basis *** Beautifully refined . </s>
<s> Complex , elegant , long with the amazing precision so typical of the producer . </s>
<s> Lovely . </s>
<s> **** Eccentric - very rancio - complex and interesting - I need more time with this but for now *** </s>
<s> Raspingly dry , mineral , appley , severe , touch of honey developing , long . </s>
<s> ***(*) Very fresh , lifted , aromatic . </s>
<s> Top * Dry , clean , unassuming . </s>
<s> Touch of spritz . </s>
<s> * Fruity , peachy . </s>
<s> Dry again . </s>
<s> More richness . </s>
<s> Nice sense of place . </s>
<s> I could even think of *** Quite mouthfilling - dry , fruity . </s>
<s> Nice . </s>
<s> ** Soft , cigar cassis fruit - sweet finish . </s>
<s> Pleasant . </s>
<s> Nice condition . </s>
<s> *** Soft blackcurrant fruit - with tannic background that starts to show in the midpalate . </s>
<s> Odd balance . </s>
<s> ** A bit stinky at first - resolves - tar roses but the common old Barolo oxidativeness . </s>
<s> Tarry - quite hard work . </s>
<s> Actually probably good . </s>
<s> Top *** Rich again - gamy animal dry - could do with long decanting . </s>
<s> Bare **** Dark orange . </s>
<s> Very barley - sugar - nice balance - appetizing finish . </s>
<s> *** Slightly lighter , fruitier . </s>
<s> Slightly oily textured . </s>
<s> Bare *** A bit faded , pleasant , lightweight . </s>
<s> Bare *** </s>
<s> Charming tempranillo sweet strawberry nose . </s>
<s> Good balance and elegant . </s>
<s> A good *** Modern stuff , rather lacking depth and complexity . </s>
<s> ** At peak or just over . </s>
<s> Rather like a decent Cotes - du - Rhone , with a rustic edge . </s>
<s> *** Pretty awful - very soft and commercial . </s>
<s> Confected . </s>
<s> * A couple of wines from a big bash at an Edinburgh hotel . </s>
<s> It ' s a good idea once in a while to remember where the baseline is . </s>
<s> Clean , pretty dry , but low on real concentration . </s>
<s> A respectable No Stars Clean again , clearly rather dilute , quite leafy and a touch of ( not necessarily bad ) green - ness . </s>
<s> Again a respectable No Stars Each done as a vertical - single blind A slightly embarrassing start to the evening with people thinking this was vintage ( 1990 or 1996 ), possibly Krug , possibly Billecart . </s>
<s> Lovely wine whatever . </s>
<s> A touch of pink on the colour - a blush to cover our blushes . </s>
<s> Elegant , good length and fine balanced acidity . </s>
<s> A really good , cheap ( under 15 ) fizz . </s>
<s> **** Mature with Grenache cherry showing through . </s>
<s> Charming nose . </s>
<s> Slightly simple on the palate . </s>
<s> A good *** Slightly flat liquorice nose . </s>
<s> More depth than the 98 . </s>
<s> Closed up and allowing the alcohol to show through , but I think this will come together well . </s>
<s> ***(*) A touch gummy and with a hint of leather . </s>
<s> Drier than many . </s>
<s> Robust . </s>
<s> **** Youthful ( obviously the youngest wine of this flight ). </s>
<s> Powerful wine with lovely softy tannins at the end . </s>
<s> **(**) Past its peak , although still very drinkable . </s>
<s> Fruit is starting to dry out and a touch of volatility is appearing . </s>
<s> ** This vintage had a juiciness about the fruit that was lacking in the other wines , but was also maturing well - at an in - between phase I guess . </s>
<s> *** Corked . </s>
<s> Not Rated Green tannins , dry at the end , a long , soft , not that pleasant leathery length . </s>
<s> *** Vegetal blackcurrant . </s>
<s> Soft and not together . </s>
<s> ** Very young and closed . </s>
<s> Minty . </s>
<s> But does it have the structure ? </s>
<s> *** A stinky nose to start with . </s>
<s> Leather , and just beginning to dry out . </s>
<s> *** a touch vegetal , and some volatility . </s>
<s> Just *** a bit of blackcurrant , clean and nicely together . </s>
<s> A top *** Some thought this stunk rather . </s>
<s> I thought it the finest wine of this flight . </s>
<s> Lovely fragrant mature Shiraz nose . </s>
<s> At peak . </s>
<s> Good . </s>
<s> **** Toffeed , bit dry , volatile . </s>
<s> No Stars Cream crackers on the nose ( no that ' s not rhyming slang ). </s>
<s> Vanilla . </s>
<s> Simple . </s>
<s> *** Quite acidic , some fruit . </s>
<s> A solid *** Corked . </s>
<s> Not Rated Simple cherry fruit and acidity . </s>
<s> Rustic at the end . </s>
<s> *** Sweet maturity . </s>
<s> At peak . </s>
<s> A top *** Very slight almost unnoticeable spritz , but otherwise mature and together and pleasant drinking . </s>
<s> A top *** Young and closed , but seemed a bit simple . </s>
<s> **(*) </s>
<s> On the whole , well made stuff , but there does seem to be an odd dull metallic note to the wine . </s>
<s> Otherwise there is soft , well - balanced fruit . </s>
<s> ** A good , fruity , balanced drink . </s>
<s> Pleasant food or quaffing wine . </s>
<s> *** The usual Penfold ' s style - well made , and with a touch of volatility helping with the balance . </s>
<s> *** </s>
<s> Dry , clean , nice piney ( is that allowed ?) </s>
<s> spicy perhaps is better . </s>
<s> Reasonable complexity once it has warmed up above the icy temperature at which it was served . </s>
<s> Decent length . </s>
<s> Top ** Nice white - pepper spicyness - balanced and long - the extreme nature of the vintage less apparent than I feared . </s>
<s> **(*) Honied - interesting green - tinged high - toned fruit . </s>
<s> Bone - dry and rather nice . </s>
<s> Time to drink though . </s>
<s> Bare *** </s>
<s> Fresh , grassy , a bit vegetal . </s>
<s> Fruity and a touch sweet . </s>
<s> Top * Drier , quite intense . </s>
<s> Hints at almonds and lime . </s>
<s> ** Slightly corked . </s>
<s> Not Rated A touch reductive / sulphury . </s>
<s> Forward fruit - pleasantly dry . </s>
<s> Top ** Nice intensity . </s>
<s> Aniseed . </s>
<s> Fades a touch . </s>
<s> Good value . </s>
<s> *** A touch of ginger . </s>
<s> Rounded fruit like a top - class Macon . </s>
<s> Nice intensity and clean , pretty dry palate . </s>
<s> Very good . </s>
<s> ***(*) Intense pure cassis , ripe with some quite dry succulent tannins . </s>
<s> Fairly sweet impression on the palate . </s>
<s> ** Sickly toffee - fudge nose . </s>
<s> Sweet fruit . </s>
<s> I don ' t like this . </s>
<s> * Sweet soft - drink fruit . </s>
<s> It expands a bit but I still find it too soft . </s>
<s> For somebody who likes the style : *** Very sweet , some mushroomyness but so sickly - might almost be a desert wine . </s>
<s> I really don ' t want to drink this . </s>
<s> I can ' t even bring myself to give it stars on an " if you like this sort of thing " basis . </s>
<s> No Stars Quite sweet - very soft fruit . </s>
<s> Herby and lifted . </s>
<s> Decent * Still a bit soft for my palate - has Mt E always been this easy ? </s>
<s> Certainly the best of the three . </s>
<s> Bare *** Almost Madeira - like . </s>
<s> It suffered a bit on serving - it was rather sedimenty . </s>
<s> Pleasant but fading a bit . </s>
<s> ** Almost dry - nice , but no better than it should be given the reputation of the vintage . </s>
<s> *** </s>
<s> Very classic cedary , mature Claret nose . </s>
<s> Classic on the palate too , but there is an air of living dangerously , of corruption , and a general hint that the wine will crack up . </s>
<s> Really needs food now and probably should be drunk in the next year or two . </s>
<s> *** Classic again on the nose , but a rather fresher , more stable palate with complex multi - faceted fruit . </s>
<s> Once open for an hour or so it becomes fragrant and high - toned . </s>
<s> Drinking well and no hurry to consume . </s>
<s> **** This was one of three Chapel Down wines ( and a few refreshing and pleasing bottled beers ) supplied by the winery . </s>
<s> I don ' t get to try an awful lot of Bacchus nowadays , although way back I used to attend the English Wine Fair and try samples there . </s>
<s> I can ' t say I miss it much . </s>
<s> This wine is floral , grapefruity and with hints of sauvignon - like flavours . </s>
<s> Strangely for a cleanly made 11 % white wine , it isn ' t the sort of stuff you want to drink a whole bottle of - it ' s not unpleasant , just that the acidity and fruit somehow manage to dull the tastebuds . </s>
<s> Hopefully the Champagne style Pinot that was also sent will be more interesting . </s>
<s> * Does wine travel well ? </s>
<s> This Champagne seems to have . </s>
<s> Packing the car recently , I opened up one of the underfoot storage compartments to pack a bottle of fizz when I found - to my surprise - a bottle already in there . </s>
<s> This , I worked out , had been in the car for the last couple of months ( going everywhere the car went - a thousand miles or so - in the cold and in the warm ). </s>
<s> Unfortunately I didn ' t have another , untravelled bottle of this around for comparsion . </s>
<s> Lovely fizz , with good nutty steely age on the palate . </s>
<s> Fine depth of flavour , although the palate does tire very slightly at the end . </s>
<s> Really on very good form . </s>
<s> **** </s>
<s> Good fruit and depth of colour . </s>
<s> Very obvious new oak on the palate . </s>
<s> Good drinkable modern wine . </s>
<s> *** </s>
<s> Fragrant , dry palate , quite meaty and serious . </s>
<s> Time to drink I guess - it will never be soft and the fruit is fully mature . </s>
<s> Rather enjoyable . </s>
<s> *** I don ' t often drink village Chablis . </s>
<s> This is a good example of what you get from a good one : all the stony minerality and dryness of a premier cru but just a bit less intense and refined . </s>
<s> Best with food . </s>
<s> ** Seems a bit thin and mean straight from cellar , but when it warms up its fantastic : dry and succulent but with intense strawberry fruit and a bit of beetroot in the mouth . </s>
<s> Quite structured - it will probably improve a bit yet . </s>
<s> Am I being overgenerous with ***(*) Quite tight and lean , I wondered a bit whether it wasn ' t a little thin when judged by the highest standards , but while not an absolute star , more and more emerged with some breathing . </s>
<s> Very well - defined hazelnut fruit and taut acidity . </s>
<s> Excellent wine with no sign of the problems that plague some wines in this vintage . </s>
<s> Top *** Lovely bright , crisp red fruits . </s>
<s> Excellent concentration and balance , great fruit but bone dry . </s>
<s> Just a lovely village wine , I thought at first - but after some time to breath it seemed to have complexity and interest beyond that . </s>
<s> Top *** Top , top quality . </s>
<s> Creamy fruit , lean , complex and mineral - with only a slightly reduced intensity and length reflecting the modest vintage . </s>
<s> **** Very good village wine - good fruit and the fine acidity of the vintage . </s>
<s> Delicious . </s>
<s> A good *** Quite rich , forward , exotic fruit . </s>
<s> Drinking nicely . </s>
<s> This bottle had been forgotten in a freezer overnight , and then thawed - didn ' t seem to have done much damage , and as my host remarked it ' s an easy way of opening the bottle . </s>
<s> ** Pure , quite mineral , the fact that this is a " no new oak " wine very pleasingly evident . </s>
<s> Quite a lot of richness to the fruit too , specially once it had been open for half an hour . </s>
<s> Could probably do with a couple of years and might age well for longer . </s>
<s> Nice wine . </s>
<s> Bare *** </s>
<s> Understated , quite complex , but a little flat and dominated by a caramel / toffee overlay that I ' m not keen on . </s>
<s> Being a Tempier fan I was expecting a lot from this , but on this showing I ' m not wildly keen . </s>
<s> ** Dull , very deep - coloured and tending to oxidation . </s>
<s> Nothing like a couple of other halves of this from the same lot which were lovely . </s>
<s> An early case of " poxy white Burgundy " or just a dodgy cork ? </s>
<s> Not Rated Attractive and drinkable , but lacking the mineral complexity of the Launois NV drunk recently . </s>
<s> *** Pleasant mature rieslong - needing drinking fairly soon . </s>
<s> Bare *** Writing up my notes from visiting D - J in Rully persuaded me to open this , brought back from their cellars . </s>
<s> Bright , attractive and authentic , but lacking any special buzz . </s>
<s> I wrote that on initially drinking a glass or two : returning the following night this has opened out and is showing lovely minerality . </s>
<s> Scrapes ***(*) </s>
<s> From a magnum ( well it was New Year ' s Eve ). </s>
<s> I think I ' ve had this bottle for five plus years . </s>
<s> Lovely stuff - beautifully balanced . </s>
<s> Could still have used a few more years . </s>
<s> A very easy **** </s>
<s> Deep colour , very yeasty nose and honied appley fruit with bags of mushrooms . </s>
<s> Evolved . </s>
<s> Quite bold and rich . </s>
<s> Long and delicious , provided you like the meaty , not so elegant , Bollinger style - it ' s not everyones glass of bubbles . </s>
<s> Top **** Quite elegant but rich ( some botrytis perhaps ). </s>
<s> Very fine . </s>
<s> ***(*) Mineral , nice fruit , dry and taught . </s>
<s> Starting to drink nicely . </s>
<s> Bare **** Deep colour , rather lovely , gentle , long , mellow , nutty and delightful . </s>
<s> Some say a little lacking poise or complexity but I quite like it . </s>
<s> *** Pure , quite light and aetherial ( the vineyard perhaps ). </s>
<s> Nice length and texture . </s>
<s> Pleasingly little oak . </s>
<s> Still improving but may be won ' t merit another star . </s>
<s> Pretty good . </s>
<s> *** Dusty , quite large but dry . </s>
<s> Tending towards baked ( typical of the vintage ) - a little chunky . </s>
<s> Still pretty good . </s>
<s> Quite a Clarety style of Burgundy . </s>
<s> Bare ***(*) Closed at first , but opens out - lovely pure raspberry fruit . </s>
<s> High - toned . </s>
<s> Very long . </s>
<s> Needs a few more years to peak . </s>
<s> ****(*) Dry , nice , savoury , but time to drink . </s>
<s> Top *** Colour tending to brown . </s>
<s> Quite animal , rich and decadent - fades a bit in the glass and rapidly becomes cloying . </s>
<s> ** Amazing dense young colour . </s>
<s> Floral , mineral , tobacco . </s>
<s> Iodine finish . </s>
<s> Very fine indeed . </s>
<s> ***** Mineral nose , rich cherry fruit hot iron finish . </s>
<s> Fantastic interest - packed with ripe tannins . </s>
<s> Great balance - but lots of potential . </s>
<s> Top ****(*) Very easy , silky , forward . </s>
<s> Touch of class . </s>
<s> I would like to try this from a stronger vintage and with a bit of age . </s>
<s> *** Apricot fruit , creamy texture and flavour . </s>
<s> No great complexity ( typical of Eiswein ). </s>
<s> Lovely acidity . </s>
<s> Bare **** As it opens up , rather fine - raspberry fruit , touch of chocolate , a bit spirity towards the end . </s>
<s> Moderate weight now . </s>
<s> Top **** Very fresh , lots of fizz . </s>
<s> Touch of yeast , etc - a touch shorter and less weighty than the Bolly . </s>
<s> In spectacularly good condition and with fine , precise bready flavours . </s>
<s> Lovely Top **** </s>
<s> From a half . </s>
<s> Its usual reliable self - fine bubbles and good medium - weight balance . </s>
<s> *** From a half . </s>
<s> Simple and charming . </s>
<s> I love claret like this , especially when the purpose of the evening is purely social rather than wine related . </s>
<s> This is at peak and a pleasure to drink . </s>
<s> *** OK stuff with decent fruit . </s>
<s> A touch coarse . </s>
<s> ** Beautiful . </s>
<s> Especially after a bottle of indifferent Prosecco drunk with candied (?) </s>
<s> hibiscus flowers in the glass . </s>
<s> The Lynch - Bages is elegant , and suggests an inner depth that is not at present fully forthcoming . </s>
<s> Hints of peach kernel and tempered steel . </s>
<s> **** Poor alongside the Lynch - Bages . </s>
<s> Too soft and undemanding . </s>
<s> *** This needs a bit more time . </s>
<s> Good structure and supple tannins - medium length . </s>
<s> A good *** </s>
<s> Brought round by a friend for a Sunday lunch . </s>
<s> A slight whiff of the farmyard when first opened , but this cleared to reveal a light - to - medium weight claret with classic cigar box . </s>
<s> *** </s>
<s> Rich vanilla fruit , excellent concentration . </s>
<s> Not the last word in elegance and the mousse is a bit coarse - but overall a splendid wine . </s>
<s> At least a good ***(*) Fruitcakey Claret , quite big and robust - seems a little woody at first but returning a day later it ' s clean , nicely - toned mature wine . </s>
<s> Chunky and in the final analysis not that complex , but good . </s>
<s> *** </s>
<s> Vanillan , lovely mousse , very elegant . </s>
<s> Understated class . </s>
<s> **** Rich , good riesling character , quite a lot of residual sugar . </s>
<s> Good in its way . </s>
<s> *** Lovely fresh fruit . </s>
<s> Complex , delicate nose . </s>
<s> Falls off a bit in the mouth . </s>
<s> Opens out with some air and holds up well on returning after the other wines . </s>
<s> This is one of their lesser wines - it ' s a credit to the property . </s>
<s> *** Rich , lively , smoky , very nice . </s>
<s> Less fine than the Cubillo but richer . </s>
<s> ( From a half .) </s>
<s> *** Inky , tannic , plummy , a bit baked . </s>
<s> Lovely secondary characters merging . </s>
<s> ***(**) Suaver , rounder , suggestive of Pomerol . </s>
<s> Pure and a touch higher - toned than the Barton . </s>
<s> Not ready but a bit shorter - term too . </s>
<s> Top ***(*) Terribly refined , mature Claret . </s>
<s> Great breed and balance . </s>
<s> I sometimes find Pichon just a little too suave and lacking edge for my tastes , but this is a super wine . </s>
<s> **** Nice old nose . </s>
<s> A touch of tea - good but doesn ' t develop on the palate . </s>
<s> Creamy vanilla . </s>
<s> Just a bit rubbery but that becomes less noticeable as it opens in the glass . </s>
<s> *** Gamy , mineral yet edgy and unbalanced . </s>
<s> Interesting yet also slightly flawed . </s>
<s> Possibly a dodgy bottle . </s>
<s> Top *** Rich , limey fruit . </s>
<s> Young - seeming . </s>
<s> Apple finish . </s>
<s> Excellent - marred ever so slightly by a raw woody background . </s>
<s> Top *** A touch pruney and hard - opens up a bit but remains a bit unsatifyingly remote . </s>
<s> I would expect more . </s>
<s> *** Fresh , fragrant raspberry nose . </s>
<s> Fine , elegany , light palate . </s>
<s> Joyfully lovely . </s>
<s> ***** </s>
<s> Elegant as always , silky - testured drinking wine . </s>
<s> but I don ' t feel this has the power for long - term evolution that ( say ) the 1990 has . </s>
<s> Drinking nicely now . </s>
<s> Top *** Drinking ( from a half ) really beautifully now . </s>
<s> A delight . </s>
<s> **** I recall being a bit disappointed last time I drank one of these magnums . </s>
<s> This one however is delightful , mature , berryish St Emilion . </s>
<s> Breed and balance to the fore . </s>
<s> Very good drinking . </s>
<s> Top *** </s>
<s> Initially modern , rich , almost flashy . </s>
<s> Later , gamy . </s>
<s> Not sure what to make of this - it ' s not like the Vallana wines of old but it is quite substantial . </s>
<s> Top ** Pure , luscious . </s>
<s> Not really a keeper on this showing . </s>
<s> Top *** Funky , showing age , substantial but odd . </s>
<s> *** Nicely integrated , a touch sweet and easy perhaps but high quality . </s>
<s> Top *** </s>
<s> Fragrant nose with a tar underlay . </s>
<s> High - toned , pure yet quite gutsy tannins too . </s>
<s> Persistent on the finish with chocolatey notes . </s>
<s> It ' s pretty tightly wound still and a bit enigmatic . </s>
<s> My guess is a bare ***(*) </s>
<s> Clean , dry , attractive . </s>
<s> Very drinkable . </s>
<s> ** </s>
<s> Very pure , high - toned yet silky fruit . </s>
<s> Somewhat in the Burgundian style but with roses , tar and chocolate and noticable but ripe Nebbiolo tannins . </s>
<s> On the other hand it has that floral scentedness of proper old - fashioned Bordeaux . </s>
<s> Doubtless worth keeping a few years but it is so well - made it is a pleasure to drink now . </s>
<s> Top *** </s>
<s> Perhaps starting to tire a bit nice fruit , quite dry - seeming now with a bit of Pfalzy weight and a hint of hardness . </s>
<s> Pleasant enough . </s>
<s> ** </s>
<s> Yeasty , quite meaty . </s>
<s> Rich . </s>
<s> Needs a few years . </s>
<s> I haven ' t had a recently purchased bottle of Pol for a while and was surprised by its weight . </s>
<s> Good though . </s>
<s> *** Lovely sous - bois and blackberry nose , silky fruit , ripe ( in the modern style ) with succulent , tannins . </s>
<s> Rather classy in a fairly modern way . </s>
<s> ( A quick thrash onGoogle reveals this one some sort of IWC trophy - I can understand that .) </s>
<s> Not entirely my sort of thing but still perhaps worth a bare ***(*) Iodine and iron , rich , decadent , fleshy . </s>
<s> Fruitcake fruit . </s>
<s> Good , and time to drink . </s>
<s> Bare **** </s>
<s> Tight acidity , fine and intense . </s>
<s> I ' ve been a bit up - and - down about this wine but I ' m sure I like this bottle . </s>
<s> Perhaps even **** Quite big , a touch flabby , rather evolved and vegetal . </s>
<s> I ' m not sure what combination of producer , vintage and possibly premature oxidation accounts for this , being unfamiliar with the first two factors in this case . </s>
<s> Still pretty drinkable . </s>
<s> Bare *** Lightweight , feminine and fragrant although with quite a hard core running through it that suggests drinking with food . </s>
<s> Modest acidity , and so I am not sure how long this is for keeping . </s>
<s> Very pleasant but without real distinction at the highest level . </s>
<s> Top *** Not very striking . </s>
<s> ** Herby nose , quite tight and nicely balanced for the vintage . </s>
<s> *** Juicy , succulent , a touch of minerality . </s>
<s> Very good : drinking but will probably improve a bit yet . </s>
<s> *** An attractive combionation of piquant high - toned fruit with a lovely rounded ripeness . </s>
<s> Very good - for drinking over the next few years , I think . </s>
<s> Top *** ( Domaine de la Bon Gran ) Rather rich , touch of botrytis probably , pretty good . </s>
<s> *** Really nice - quite forward as the producers wines tend to be , quite big but in balance . </s>
<s> No hint of the problems of the vintage . </s>
<s> Top *** The second bottle of H . Lignier 1er cru from this vintage I have tried recently . </s>
<s> This is so pure , digestible and generally fine , but understated - it doesn ' t shout and it doesn ' t have a particular note of individuality for me . </s>
<s> Yet it is a complete wine that I like a lot . </s>
<s> Beginning to drink well , but not a long - haul wine . </s>
<s> Top *** </s>
<s> Notably off - dry still , very fresh with rounded , attractive fruit . </s>
<s> Good . </s>
<s> *** Lovely apple and cream nose , slightly honied and a touch of yeast . </s>
<s> Fine mousse too . </s>
<s> Lovely . </s>
<s> A 93 / 94 / 95 blend I believe . </s>
<s> Top **** That old Rioja nose of nuts and mushrooms and something slightly medical - lovely . </s>
<s> Very fresh , nicely rounded fruit . </s>
<s> Ultimately I suppose not complex enough to be a great wine but rather good . </s>
<s> Bare **** Good intensity , the fruit has a distinct character : mineral , not fruit - driven , something almost secondary about what is surely primary fruit . </s>
<s> Very engaging . </s>
<s> Top *** Very gentle , completely resolved , pleasantly enjoyable . </s>
<s> *** All very lovely , but despite the deftness of the touch of new barriques , I feel it lacks the crystaline purity of his other wines . </s>
<s> *** An enigma : that slightly " flat " souuthern - French palate , but with air an engaging herby nose . </s>
<s> Is it going anywhere ? </s>
<s> I ' m not sure . </s>
<s> Top ** Lovely cherry fruit . </s>
<s> Very attractive . </s>
<s> *** Good Syrah character , fruit - driven but not to the point of undrinkability . </s>
<s> Pleasant . </s>
<s> Scrapes ** Substantial and weighty , notable botrytis , interesting palate but perhaps tending towards rustic . </s>
<s> This was just a taste - I ' d be interested to try more . </s>
<s> *** Fruit still has a lot of primary blackcurrant but the structure seems resolved so I guess this is for drinking now . </s>
<s> Creamy , some cigar - box , all in all attractive fruit , but a little too undemanding to rate a really high score . </s>
<s> Top *** I guess I could get used to this trocken business : this has good fruit and is bone - dry without being harsh . </s>
<s> Still fairly moderate alcohol at 12 %, the overall balance is good . </s>
<s> A year or two short of its peak , I suspect . </s>
<s> *** Blackberry fruit , some oak I think - quite tannic perhaps from the oak . </s>
<s> Modern - style . </s>
<s> ** An interesting expression of the Langhe , if with a modern tinge of new oak . </s>
<s> Everything Conterno makes iselegan and drinkable and this is no exception . </s>
<s> On the other hand I can ' t feel it is ultimately distinguished in the way that his Barolos are . </s>
<s> A mix of four grape varietoes including Nebbiolo . </s>
<s> Bare *** Round berry fruit , quite a lot of blackcurrant , some tobacco . </s>
<s> Very nice mature Claret , if tending slightly towards the rustic - lacks the fineness of a top wine . </s>
<s> Good though . </s>
<s> *** Quite spritzy initially but the next day that had dissipated and the honeysuckle Soave charcter and pure fruit very evident . </s>
<s> Good length too . </s>
<s> Top **(*) This is better every time I try it - class will out and I think it is Le Mesnil fruit that is giving it such minerality and complexity . </s>
<s> Delicious . </s>
<s> **** My last bottle of this . </s>
<s> It ' s really a relaxed , fully mature , attractive and balanced wine . </s>
<s> Enough complexity to be interesting and the primary fruit that I remember being rather excessive years ago is now nicely in balance . </s>
<s> Very good . </s>
<s> I notice in passing that it is a relativel modest 12 . 5 % alcohol . </s>
<s> *** Very classy , pure , blackberry and apple fruit . </s>
<s> Demanding but ripe tannins , very succulent . </s>
<s> Really good Dolcetto . </s>
<s> *** Spritzy from dissolved CO2 I guess . </s>
<s> Excellent richness of fruit , intensity and length . </s>
<s> Nice sweetness balanced by really good acidity . </s>
<s> At least ***(*) Lovely bright appetising Mosel wine , yet with a rich fruitiness . </s>
<s> Very attractive . </s>
<s> Top *** The second time I ' ve tried this recently . </s>
<s> It ' s an Ozzie - like Cabernet Syrah blend but with a very unozzie dry palate . </s>
<s> Seems to get better the longer it is open . </s>
<s> Fine wine . </s>
<s> *** A dry dark Oloroso - like palate - what a P . C . </s>
<s> ought to have I guess but I often find them more Amontillado there too as well as on the nose . </s>
<s> Rather good . </s>
<s> 15 years old according to their web site . </s>
<s> Top *** </s>
<s> Spicy riesling petrolly nose . </s>
<s> Pretty dry - good length . </s>
<s> But fairly simple and light . </s>
<s> * Again petrolly - rather richer . </s>
<s> Quite good concentration . </s>
<s> Dry . </s>
<s> I wonder how this will go given it is already so petrolly . </s>
<s> ** Honey and caramel . </s>
<s> Butter . </s>
<s> Less intense on the palate . </s>
<s> Good ** Less ambitious and benefits from that - in fact reasonably concentrated and intense . </s>
<s> *** Unusually intense vanilla nose . </s>
<s> Damp straw - quite heavy - textured . </s>
<s> ** Honied and rich . </s>
<s> Charred nose and oily fruit . </s>
<s> Big and long . </s>
<s> Impressive in its way ( which is not my way ). </s>
<s> Bare *** Berry nose . </s>
<s> Oddly rasping finish . </s>
<s> ** Minty . </s>
<s> Similar - finishes a bit abruptly . </s>
<s> ** Minty . </s>
<s> A bit toffeed . </s>
<s> High - toned . </s>
<s> I ' m not wild about this . </s>
<s> ** Liquor blackberries . </s>
<s> Medium - weight palate - oddly bitter finish . </s>
<s> Might be going to be rather good . </s>
<s> ( I keep getting this wine in situations where I can ' t sit back , drink a couple of glasses and think about it . </s>
<s> I must try and do that at some point .) </s>
<s> *** Dry , pure , well - made . </s>
<s> Balanced . </s>
<s> *** Liquour raspberry again . </s>
<s> A bit thick . </s>
<s> Softer and lacking the attack of the 2001 . </s>
<s> ** Hints at mint again . </s>
<s> Oddly twisty . </s>
<s> Yet more balanced than the Chileans . </s>
<s> ** Quite fresh , fruity , straw - like . </s>
<s> High - toned . </s>
<s> Rather nice . </s>
<s> *** Pleasant and gracefully old - perhaps going a bit flat . </s>
<s> Top ** I spent the day moving paving slabs ( heavy and intense ) and making fish stock ( light and intense ). </s>
<s> The stock was poured over some cod , sea bass , spinach and creme fraiche ( this isn ' t Fine Wine Dairy , but it does pay to get decent creme fraiche ) and then baked in the oven with a little grated parmesan . </s>
<s> Stroganoff , excellent cheeses from the Cambridge Cheese Company and a passion fruit tart from Maison Blanc in Oxford ( that my daughter was very passionate about ) followed . </s>
<s> Good fizz which is perhaps just beginning to tire . </s>
<s> Medium weight and with a hint of oxidation . </s>
<s> Top *** Rather simple after the de Venoge - lighter weight . </s>
<s> Some complexity emerges after a while in the glass . </s>
<s> *** This was the sort of bottle you would avoid even on the most generous of bin - end offers : the label stained and some evidence that the wine was seeping through the cork and dribbling down the capsule . </s>
<s> However , the wine inside was lovely . </s>
<s> This was as tight a Riesling as you could hope to taste with classic minerality and finely tuned acidity . </s>
<s> A really fine effort with time ahead . </s>
<s> ***(*) One of those wines where the first sniff tells you that you are in the presence of something special . </s>
<s> Glorious sweet St Julien fruit with a palate that is on first taste deceptively simple . </s>
<s> None of the Â  typical Talbot whiff of the barnyard ' that Broadbent notes , but rather , on this showing , a wine of great purity and lasting structure . </s>
<s> Superb , and at a glorious peak . </s>
<s> ***** From magnum . </s>
<s> I guess this was always going to be a come down after the previous wine ( I rather naughtily tasted them in this order when others at the table were more conventional in their drinking order ). </s>
<s> This is reliable stuff that is drinking well with its tarry , coffee and chocolate overtones . </s>
<s> Good claret that , enjoyable though it is ( I am drinking it whilst typing these notes ), gets relegated , for now , to the luncheon division . </s>
<s> A good *** From a half . </s>
<s> Delicious and aging rather well . </s>
<s> Good apricoty acidity and with a sweetness that is verging on being oversweet , but which is contained within the framework of the wine . </s>
<s> I think this will age into something truly great . </s>
<s> ****(*) </s>
<s> Showing its age with a tendency towards maderisation but very drinkable with yeasty rich fruit and good length . </s>
<s> **** Like a Viognier almost , nicely intense . </s>
<s> Top ** Pure black - cherry fruit in profusion . </s>
<s> Good concentration and so on , with a slightly cassis character that seems quite common in modern wines . </s>
<s> How will this age I wonder ? </s>
<s> Probably quite well although the whole package is a bit soft for my taste . </s>
<s> Top *** Fragrant , lightweight ( a very poor vintage of course ), no very great length , needs drinking soon but it still has lovely minerality and is very stylish . </s>
<s> Top *** Meatier , longer and generally a bit more substantial than the 93 with a slight bitterness on the finish that will probably ease further although the wine must be close to peak . </s>
<s> Again so individual and so much a terroir wine . </s>
<s> I love it . </s>
<s> Bare **** Backward , dense but fragrant and long . </s>
<s> Coming towards peak . </s>
<s> Really lovely . </s>
<s> ****(*) This has rather a baked fruit character that I am not so keen on . </s>
<s> It is hard to taste against great wines like the Gentaz , but only a top ** Fragrant , dry and long . </s>
<s> More mineral and complex than the other Ogier wines . </s>
<s> Really lovely and should be drunk on its own away from the Gentaz wines that tend to upstage it . </s>
<s> **** An absolute star that could even benefit from another year or two . </s>
<s> Tremendous weight , and concentrated minerality but all in balance . </s>
<s> Fantastic . </s>
<s> Top ***** Needs a swirl or two in the glass but characteristic Cote Rotie violets emerge . </s>
<s> Very good . </s>
<s> Top *** This has a solid core of fruit , and the minerality and complexity that all the wines possess . </s>
<s> It is a touch harder and a touch less strong all round than the 89 however . </s>
<s> Bare ***** Fragrant , balanced , easy - going wine with a nice dry finish . </s>
<s> Good *** Corked . </s>
<s> Not Rated Awkwardly dry and rather short . </s>
<s> Would go down quite well with food perhaps but not great - hardly surprising given the vintage . </s>
<s> Top ** Asian spices ( as R . P . </s>
<s> so often says ). </s>
<s> Fresh ( almost youthful still ) with fantastically long fruit . </s>
<s> Gorgeous . </s>
<s> Top ***** Oxidised - might be an odd bottle so I won ' t rate it but of course at this age from this vintage they might all be this way . </s>
<s> Not Rated More awkward than the 85 - it lacks that wines easy balance . </s>
<s> But this is really complex and the minerality is perhaps even more pronounced . </s>
<s> Intellectual wine and really good . </s>
<s> ***** More open and leafy , lacks the poise of the best vintages but does give a long mineral mouthful . </s>
<s> **** Top stuff but a little flabby and keroseney for a special cuvee from this producer . </s>
<s> Top *** Mineral , broad , intense with a restrained , crystalline purity . </s>
<s> Brilliant . </s>
<s> ***** </s>
<s> Pale tangerine colour in a decanter . </s>
<s> Intensely gingery on the nose ( as Ramonet ' s wines often are ) but to a grotesque degree . </s>
<s> Rather horrible palate - probably just oxidised but in a rather odd way . </s>
<s> A day later the oxidation aspect less apparent but still extravagently gingery and with a dull flatness . </s>
<s> No Stars Much more what one expects - plenty of acid , quite juicy , nice fruit . </s>
<s> *** Quite leafy liquid tobacco . </s>
<s> This seems to have gone backwards a bit since I last tasted it - clearly needs a few years but good drinking now too . </s>
<s> ***(*) </s>
<s> According to the front label ' An original blend of 95 % SYRAH '; according to the back label a ' wonderful accompaniment to chicken dishes , goat ' s cheese tart or full flavoured cheeses ' and ' Suitable for vegetarians and vegans '. </s>
<s> Unlike the labelling , the wine isn ' t too contrived . </s>
<s> Good balance and good red fruit depth . </s>
<s> It will probably improve with a few years age . </s>
<s> By the way , the other 5 % is Mouvedre [ sic ]. </s>
<s> Just **(*) I wasn ' t expecting much of this - Sunday evening combined with a general foreboding about white Rhones . </s>
<s> What a revelation though ! </s>
<s> Glorious full bodied stuff with a lovely toffee and honeysuckle length to the palate . </s>
<s> A wine I could drink and drink - and not just on Sundays . </s>
<s> **** </s>
<s> Good old fizz with touches of honey , wood and aniseed . </s>
<s> Medium bodied and with the acidity to keep the mature flavours together . </s>
<s> **** A disappointing wine in some sense . </s>
<s> Quite winey , and doesn ' t really have the class one expects . </s>
<s> Relatively ( for a big name from ' 96 ) rather simple and lacking the drama and complexity of something to tuck away for the future . </s>
<s> Possibly an off form bottle . </s>
<s> **(*) </s>
<s> Exotic , rich , old - fashioned . </s>
<s> Splendid . </s>
<s> *** Peachy , exotic , quite evolved . </s>
<s> Made to drink fairly young , but has that Grand Cru something about it . </s>
<s> Bare **** So floral , pure and beautiful . </s>
<s> Intense , dry . </s>
<s> Approachable but lots of underlying structure . </s>
<s> Completely gorgeous . </s>
<s> *****(*) Mineral , very attractive , drinking nicely . </s>

<s> ***(**) Leaner , sea breezes . </s>
<s> Very classic . </s>
<s> Lovely . </s>
<s> ( In time the 89 will be the better wine I guess .) </s>

<s> Very classic . </s>
<s> ***** Thanks to everybody for bringing interesting and enjoyable wines , and to Centotre for feeding us well . </s>
<s> Dry , rich , appetising . </s>
<s> Long . </s>
<s> Pretty nice . </s>
<s> I feel a bit of barrique aging is aiming at an international market , but it is good . </s>
<s> I ' d like to sit down and drink a few glasses one evening . </s>
<s> Maybe even scrapes *** Quite Burgundian weight . </s>
<s> Oaky ( but quite well handled ) Chardonnay . </s>
<s> Classy - needs time though . </s>
<s> I find the Tunina a bit more individual but this is pretty good . </s>
<s> Bare ***(*) As usual , a melange of flavours . </s>
<s> Delicious . </s>
<s> Bare **** Turkish Delight . </s>
<s> Dry . </s>
<s> Could be a bit tiring although perhaps Gewurz is ever that way . </s>
<s> Nice balance of rose - scented fruit with a dry palate . </s>
<s> Good length . </s>
<s> Another wine I ' dlike to try " properly ". </s>
<s> A good *** Big - scaled wine - top Chianti as I ' d expect from this wine in such a fine vintage . </s>
<s> Bare ***(*) Stinky at first - blows off to reveal a really good taught , balanced wine . </s>
<s> Rather good , I think . </s>
<s> Bare ***(*) Herby . </s>
<s> Good balance . </s>
<s> Very drinkable . </s>
<s> *** Suave , silky , dry . </s>
<s> Quite structured . </s>
<s> Easy **(*) A bit dry - might improve but seems a bit austere . </s>
<s> But rather a nice nose . </s>
<s> **(*) Scented nose but tannic . </s>
<s> Serious , I find the new oak tannins a bit more difficult young than the traditional style . </s>
<s> But the oak is done well and terroir shows through . </s>
<s> Pretty concentrated - fine wine . </s>
<s> This has quite a lot of quality and might evolve well in a Sandrone sort of way . </s>
<s> **(**) Light elegant , quite fine . </s>
<s> I feel I ' ve had slightly better bottles of this . </s>
<s> Top *** More body but perhaps a touch less well delineated than the Sandrone . </s>
<s> Very nice approaching maturity . </s>
<s> Bare **** So delicate , mineral , fine and long . </s>
<s> Just ready . </s>
<s> ***** A bit extracted and a bitter for my palate . </s>
<s> Not my sort of thing , although there ' s alot of wine in the glass . </s>
<s> Perhaps I might warm to it with more time . </s>
<s> Good ** Dry , savoury , cooked fruits . </s>
<s> Mushrooms , nuts . </s>
<s> Really good Amarone . </s>
<s> Maybe even ***(*) Nice way to finish - well - balanced and delicious . </s>
<s> Top *** </s>
<s> Dry , juicy , mineral , nicely made . </s>
<s> A bit thin on the mid - palate initially but it fills out with time . </s>
<s> Nice . </s>
<s> Bare ***(*) A bit more modern - styled . </s>
<s> Pleasantly creamy . </s>
<s> *** Good farmyardy , mature Burgundy - quite piquant and perhaps a touch rough with marked tannins . </s>
<s> Nice drinking but fades a little in the glass . </s>
<s> *** </s>
<s> Rather dilute , dull and uninteresting . </s>
<s> * Past it - horrible . </s>
<s> No Stars A bit tough and tannic , but with good texture . </s>
<s> Could do with a bit more fruit . </s>
<s> More drinkable than I thought it would be . </s>
<s> ** </s>
<s> Not a star village , an un - rated vineyard and a moderate vintage - it ' s amazing what sensitive winemaking can achieve . </s>
<s> Lovely , drinkable , engaging , characterful and not entirely simple fuit - nine years old and about at peak from a half . </s>
<s> Really very enjoyable . </s>
<s> *** Dense colour . </s>
<s> Quite Syrah - like at first , but more baked ( almost burnt ) plum fruit after a while . </s>
<s> Good texture - feels nice in the mouth . </s>
<s> Good structure too - this is a rather good , characterful wine . </s>
<s> Still improving and needing time , but perhaps it won ' t actually quite rate more stars . </s>
<s> *** Really quite youthful still , high - toned food wine with a touch of ( very Italian ) bitterness . </s>
<s> Nice fruit . </s>
<s> I described this as " modern " last time I drank it , but it isn ' t evolving quickly . </s>
<s> Merits *** A big hit of blackcurrant on the nose initially - and a while after it still has quite a lot of forward fruit , at least compared to the more austere higher - toned 94 . </s>
<s> Still a fine wine but I ' m having trouble getting to grips with it . </s>
<s> Say , *** Lovely high - toned brambly fruit with a touch of cranberry . </s>
<s> Good ripeness and succulent tannins , nice mineral base too - probably still improving and could even rate another star in time . </s>
<s> For now a top *** My last bottle of this : rich and flavoursome with highly evolved fruit - on my first sip I thought it was past its best , but on longer acquaintance I felt it was about at its best while needing drinking relatively soon . </s>
<s> Top *** Healthy colour - cedary , fruitcake nose and a pleasantly balanced palate . </s>
<s> Pretty much at peak , but holding nicely - a bit of air and it opens up and reveals a fragrant side too . </s>
<s> I haven ' t always been overwhelmed by the wines from this estate , but this has shifted my opinion up a bit . </s>
<s> *** Very pleasantly cedary , but this Bordeaux - style wine ' s fruit is becoming a bit thin now . </s>
<s> ** My last bottle of this : lemony vanilla , touch of sherry character but completely and enjoyably fresh and appetising . </s>
<s> Almost timeless , but I guess it wouldn ' t improve . </s>
<s> Very pleasant mature wine ( of an unfashionable sort ). </s>
<s> *** Scented , dry and savoury - old - fashioned Claret that isn ' t that weighty . </s>
<s> Very pleasant , but I think perhaps not one of the best wines from this property - it is still improving but may not rate more stars . </s>
<s> *** I haven ' t tasted this for eight years , I think . </s>
<s> I rated it very highly then as a young wine and now it has a restrained but lovely old apricot nose and a wonderful density of fruit of fruit and a rich , extravagently viscous texture . </s>
<s> There ' s a nice level of acidity too that stops it cloying and a very long finish . </s>
<s> Very lovely , but I have slight reservations about the complexity - it does seem , as one might perhaps expect from the grape , a touch one - dimensional given its other qualities . </s>
<s> **** My first sampling of Jadot ' s Beaujolais project . </s>
<s> My first thought was that I was expecting something a bit larger , but the fruit has good , under - stated concentration and there is an attractive mineral core too . </s>
<s> Very drinkable , yet there is a tannic underpinning that will give a at least a few years of positive evolution . </s>
<s> I am quite positive about htis - for now a conservative **(*) Lovely , intense , Grenache - based wine - long , balanced , like a very good Chateauneuf . </s>
<s> Easy top *** The Lamaione is a disappointing wine . </s>
<s> I remember having it for the fist time ( before FWD , in 1995 or earlier I guess ). </s>
<s> Then it oozed class , and in 1997 I still rated it highly . </s>
<s> But since then it has declined , and now one word will do : ' undrinkable ' - although I ' ve expanded slightly beyond that below . </s>
<s> I wonder whether its earlier showing was flattered by some flashy wine making ( carb . </s>
<s> mac .?). </s>
<s> There aren ' t many wines I ' ve poured down the sink , but this was one of them . </s>
<s> Harsh and astringent . </s>
<s> Completely gone . </s>
<s> No Stars I don ' t want to be unfair to this wine ( it was a quick replacement for the undrinkable Lamaione ), but this isn ' t quite of the standard that previous vintages of this wine used to be - although , possibly , it is just a bit closed . </s>
<s> * A really good bottle of this wine - it seems in the past to have varied between 3 and 4 stars . </s>
<s> This one had the good strawberry leather nose of the best bottles . </s>
<s> **** Leathery , rustic and farmyardy . </s>
<s> Not the most elagent wine ever , but it never has been . </s>
<s> Just **** </s>
<s> Touch of toast , nice middle of the road Champagne palate , medium weight , decent finish . </s>
<s> *** Quite vinous nose . </s>
<s> Chewy palate with some obvious wood influence . </s>
<s> Good length . </s>
<s> Top *** Elegant , ripe apples , fine , long finish . </s>
<s> Excellent fine mousse . </s>
<s> Not universally enjoyed , perhpas becaus it could do with some time in bottle . </s>
<s> I like the style though . </s>
<s> Scrapes **** Seems good but very slightly tainted - corked maybe , but perhaps in fact excess sulphur . </s>
<s> Takes the edge off . </s>
<s> Not Rated Dry , fragrant , nice balance . </s>
<s> *** Very toasty - one gets used to it . </s>
<s> Very tightly elegant and fine but it lacks sensory oomph a bit even though it is seriously concentrated . </s>
<s> Loses fizz quite quickly . </s>
<s> I have slightly mixed feelings about this but maybe it needs further study . </s>
<s> Top **** Quite full - bodied - a touch rustic perhaps . </s>
<s> There is something of Macon - with - bubbles about it but nevertheless it ' s very drinkable . </s>
<s> Good *** Some lovely wine , but also some disappointments . </s>
<s> I ' ve had Talbot , Gruaud Larose and Las Cases 1982 in the last few months , and whilst the first two have been stunning ; the last one is not showing well . </s>
<s> Lovely together fizz - good acidity - elegant . </s>
<s> **** Delicious weighty wine with a good , heavy acidity . </s>
<s> Stunning . </s>
<s> ***** Lovely Riesling nose - elegant palate - acidity variable , but the wine isn ' t getting flabby . </s>
<s> *** Good wine with food ( garlic and chilli prawns ), but a bit simple . </s>
<s> *** Dry finish - unknit - not really clear whether it has a direction . </s>
<s> *** Dusty and drying out . </s>
<s> ** Good but closed . </s>
<s> **(*) Drinking beautifully . </s>
<s> Easily the claret of the evening for drinking now . </s>
<s> Textbook Pauillac at a peak . </s>
<s> **** Disappointing . </s>
<s> A touch volatile at the end . </s>
<s> Weighty , but it should be better than this . </s>
<s> *** Good wine which others preferred more than me . </s>
<s> Big and balanced . </s>
<s> *** From a half . </s>
<s> Good botrytis , but the acidity is lacking . </s>
<s> Too heavily sweet for my tastes . </s>
<s> *** </s>
<s> The last time I had this , in 2002 , it seemed a weedy wine that probably wasn ' t going to live to its youthful potential . </s>
<s> It just had the odd glimpse suggesting it might improve - but I wasn ' t that convinced . </s>
<s> Fortunately though , this bottle at least is on lovely form . </s>
<s> A dry wine without flashiness , but lovely toned acidity and flavours that are constantly developing in the glass . </s>
<s> And to think that I almost decided to drink all my bottles in 2002 . </s>
<s> An easy **** Holding up well , but so dull compared with the Chateauneuf above . </s>
<s> Simple sweet flavours . </s>
<s> I suppose *** </s>
<s> Attractive nutty ( marzipan ? </s>
<s> ), tangy nose , very nicely - textured palate with solid underlying fruit and a lovely salty finish . </s>
<s> All quite refined . </s>
<s> Maybe scrapes **** Not what I expected on opening , oddly rounded fruit and a tired feeling . </s>
<s> After a while though it opens up quite nicely : bone - dry , savoury , citric , a touch of herbs and a hint of Fino Sherry . </s>
<s> Very nice and perhaps will even improve . </s>
<s> For now *** Very luxurious agreeable Oloroso that slips down a treat without generating the last word in excitement although its nose is pretty complex at least soon after opening . </s>
<s> Say *** This wine has a touch of the lifted salty tang of Manzanilla over a burnt old - wine palate with a long finish . </s>
<s> Very mouthwatering , a touch of camphor or something . </s>
<s> Seems almost better after a day or two open . </s>
<s> Very lovely . </s>
<s> Easy **** Very fine and long - tangy , hints of chocolate almost on the nose . </s>
<s> Not quite as demanding as the Coliseo from this house but very fine . </s>
<s> **** Very drinkabe old sherry , grippy and with that nice hint of sourness . </s>
<s> Not the last word in fineness however - I feel this hints a bit at dry - cleaning fluid . </s>
<s> *** Rich and long with rather greater depth than a standard Fino - salty tang too , nice acidity and a long , citric finish . </s>
<s> Very clean and pure . </s>
<s> *** </s>
<s> Not quite one thing or the other if you know what I mean . </s>
<s> Vibrant ripe fruit to start with but with a green and dilute finish . </s>
<s> Not as interesting as I would have hoped . </s>
<s> ** </s>
<s> Good fruit but perhaps a touch rustic - old straw farmyard characters of a pleasant sort . </s>
<s> Completely mature and very drinkable . </s>
<s> Forgiving it a certain rusticity one might stretch to **** Warm and ripe ( the vintage I guess ) but perhaps beginning to lose it in a graceful way . </s>
<s> Cedary but not terribly complex . </s>
<s> Bare *** Seems pretty much ready to drink - nice balance , generous fruit and a nice dry finish . </s>
<s> Bare **** Lovely appetising , drinkable wine ( breaking for another mouthful as I type ). </s>
<s> Not a hint of the varietal flab , yet lovely ripe fruit and mineral overtones . </s>
<s> Something of almonds about the whole package too . </s>
<s> This has the balance to keep well for a while I feel , and it may even improve over a year or so . </s>
<s> Dry yet not austere , and with really good length . </s>
<s> Classy . </s>
<s> *** </s>
<s> Clean , fresh and simple wine with lightweight raspberry fruit . </s>
<s> ** A touch oxidised , but I couldn ' t decide whether this was the winemaking or a duff bottle . </s>
<s> So , until I get to try it again Not Rated </s>
<s> From a magnum . </s>
<s> Good sweet fruit , chocolate and coffee . </s>
<s> Good balance for drinking now . </s>
<s> Top *** </s>
<s> Bone dry and with good intensity and length . </s>
<s> It just seems to lack a bit of pizzaz - the whole effect is a touch ( but just a touch ) flat . </s>
<s> *** Silky - textured and rich , one feels this wine is part of the transition to a modern style here . </s>
<s> But this has produced a fine wine in this vintage , voluptuous , but still with enough stuffing . </s>
<s> *** Nice mature riesling nose - completely resolved and really quite soft and lovable . </s>
<s> Top *** I have mixed feelings about this : on the plus side , fine nettle - like fruit , nicely balanced , now mature with a decent finish and a streak of minerality ; on the minus side a slight lack of real presence , just a little underwhelming considering the reputation of the producer . </s>
<s> Scrapes *** It ' s easy to scoff at Musar , and until today I hadn ' t opened one of my own bottles for a year or two , but it ' s really not half bad you know . </s>
<s> Rustic , yes - ultimately fairly simple , yes - but it does have lovely round , sweet , leathery fruit and it has aged very gracefully to a soft , amber - edged maturity . </s>
<s> So it ' s easy to scoff in the other sense too . </s>
<s> *** Some will say this is past its peak but I rather like it . </s>
<s> Mature riesling apricot flavours , old wine roundedness , very pleasant . </s>
<s> *** Quite big , ripe and sweet for spatlese . </s>
<s> Very attractive , quite forward and engaging fruit . </s>
<s> Very good rather than really riveting . </s>
<s> Top *** Quite big , ripe and rich . </s>
<s> This has a timeless quality - while showing some mature characters it is still quite sweet and very fresh - it will benefit from more time in bottle I think and will probably merit 4 stars in the long run . </s>
<s> Impressive . </s>
<s> ***(*) Remeniscent of a top Rhone Grenache : high - toned , a touch medicinal . </s>
<s> This is really good wine - intense fruit but a nice balance . </s>
<s> Top *** This has now opened up nicely - gorgeous long , mouthfilling greengage fruit . </s>
<s> It was so tight a few years ago and it has been fascinating to watch its progress . </s>
<s> It is bone dry and has that Wachau sternness that ( slightly to my surprise ) I am often a bit ambivalent about . </s>
<s> This though is drinking so nicely - perhaps it ' s just a mistage to try and drink these wines young . </s>
<s> Very top *** This seems to have become a touch more piquant and high - toned than I recall . </s>
<s> A grown - up ' s wine with tanins that might never be entirely mellow until too late , and a classic Claret nose . </s>
<s> Lovely . </s>
<s> top *** Sherberty , very open fruit , and very pleasantly drinkable at 8 % alcohol . </s>
<s> A bit spritzy at first and ever so slightly hollow on the palate , if I was going to criticise . </s>
<s> On the other hand , it has a lovely long finish . </s>
<s> Ready to drink I guess , but no great hurry . </s>
<s> Lovely . </s>
<s> Top *** Raspberry fruit , nodding at cassis also , dry , very firm as this producers wines tend to be - still a touch hard . </s>
<s> Very nice village wine coming round as it approaches its 10th birthday . </s>
<s> *** Rather nice - intense grapefruity riesling , with something towards nectarine on a persistant finish . </s>
<s> Seems quite dry to me for a classic - style Rheingau but that may partly be the particularly good acidity . </s>
<s> Drinking nicely but no hurry to consume - might even be better in a few years . </s>
<s> Top *** A high - toned wine from this most European - styled of Californian winemakers , with rich yet piquant fruit . </s>
<s> This will improve a bit I suspect but needs the right food . </s>
<s> Bare *** Seven year - old Soave ? </s>

<s> ** A bit unripe on the palate , and with coarse fruit . </s>
<s> Some ( pleasant ) signs of maturity on the nose , but not coordinated with the rest of the wine . </s>

<s> Long and delicious . </s>
<s> Top *** Rounded , forward fruit - pleasant but ultimately fairly simple . </s>

<s> Bare **** Only a year or two delayed versus the standard vintage . </s>

<s> Old beyond its years - is it an odd bottle ? </s>
<s> The guy from Bollinger says not , but seemed to have decided this before nosing mine . </s>

<s> Fragrant , mellow , eminently drinkable . </s>
<s> Fresh but a suspicion of drying at the end suggests this is not for keeping beyond another five or so years . </s>
<s> *** High - toned , a bit of cranberry , a touch of underlying meatiness and excellent fruit . </s>
<s> Lovely but without the va - va - voom of the Combe aux Moins from the same producer and vintage tasted recently . </s>
<s> Still scrapes ***(*) Lively , quite complex , proper tarry Barolo and more or less " a point ". </s>
<s> A bit coarse - textured to be worth more than *** The things one finds when cataloguing the cellar - an auction purchase of a couple of bottles I seem to recall . </s>
<s> I opened one with trepidation but no need : actually a healthy light colour and a lovely , fresh , tar and roses Barolo nose . </s>
<s> The fruit had that underlying sweetness that good Barolo has and which with the fragrance sets off the firmness of even mature tannins . </s>
<s> Not terribly complex but really very enjoyable drinking . </s>
<s> *** I have oscillated a bit about this 100 % Gargenega wine . </s>
<s> It is Ca Rugate ' s interpretation of what old Soave might have been like , I seem to recall . </s>
<s> It has a deep colour ( from skin contact , I think ) and a broad , flat , mouthfilling palate after a honeysuckle nose . </s>
<s> It reminds me a bit of one or two other Italian producers who are pushing things in a similar direction : Massa Vecchia and Gravner . </s>
<s> It is rather less grand than either ( and a bit cheaper ) but I like it , and I think time is making it more interesting . </s>
<s> *** Intense strawberry nose , solid , concentrated fruit , quite dry as often with Lafarge . </s>
<s> A touch of Italianate bitterness and quite firm tannins make it rather a food wine at the moment . </s>
<s> I hope that rawness wears off - I think it will . </s>
<s> ***(*) Surprisingly high - toned almost Amontillado - like nose . </s>
<s> Palate has warm raisiny character and a nice texture . </s>
<s> *** Very pure , raspberry fruit . </s>
<s> Now completely resolved and drinking very nicely . </s>
<s> I think it lacks the real edge of terroir at this stage , or something to add complexity . </s>
<s> Drinking pretty nicely however . </s>
<s> *** Smoky raspberry fruit , begining to show its age a bit but still fresh . </s>
<s> Very drinkable but not super - exciting . </s>
<s> *** Quite fat and mouthfilling - I haven ' t drunk this producers wines or Chablis from this vintage much so I ' m not sure about the cause of this rather atypical richness . </s>
<s> Still , this has a lovely honey - influenced palate and enough underlying minerality to be very enjoyable . </s>
<s> Absolutely at peak . </s>
<s> From a half . </s>
<s> Top *** I seem to remember having mixed feelings about a bottle of this , but this one is lovely - completely drinkable medicinally - edged concentrated Grenache . </s>
<s> Excellent . </s>

<s> Quite individual but really , really good . </s>

<s> for the last couple of years - eyeing me up each time I opened the cellar . </s>
<s> I had it last in 1999 , when it was disappointing . </s>
<s> This time though it was a glorious claret with warm , pencil - shaving nose and palate . </s>
<s> I ' m glad I ' ve resited its calling until now because this bottle was caught at its best . </s>
<s> There is a touch of weediness ( well it ' s not the best vintage ever ), but the balance is fine . </s>
<s> This is the sort of wine that makes keeping fine wine so satisfying . </s>
<s> I could drink a lot of this , alas though this was my last bottle . </s>
<s> A charming **** A coarser wine than the Pichon above , with higher toned acidity and a more granular structure . </s>
<s> Good , pleasant wine that held its own . </s>

<s> I can ' t usually get too excited about Sancerre , but this is rather enjoyable . </s>

<s> Notes are from memory - I was feeling too lazy to write anything down . </s>

<s> Fine wine but lacking any very special buzz . </s>
<s> Top *** Smoky , refined , holding nicely although for drinking in the next year or two . </s>
<s> Rather lovely . </s>
<s> Top **** Reminder to self : I must stop thinking of eighties Clarets as infants . </s>
<s> This is pretty much mature although it will probably evolve interestingly over a decade or more . </s>
<s> Very classic cigar - box and cassis . </s>
<s> A pleasure to drink . </s>
<s> Top **** Exotic , or perhaps I just don ' t drink enough Brunello . </s>
<s> Fresh , herby , redolent in a curious way of ice - cream . </s>
<s> Very attractive . </s>
<s> Top *** Coming towards maturity - great breeding : fine balance in quite a weighty wine . </s>
<s> All the classic Barsac characteristics . </s>
<s> **** Green - rimmed , quite fresh , elegant nose . </s>

<s> A bit disappointing - too easy to drink . </s>
<s> That may sound odd , but I want my Chablis with some green acidity and this wine is too soft and lacking structure . </s>

<s> Good stuff . </s>
<s> *** Opened with trepidation given Toby ' s recent article ablout 1996 white Burgundy . </s>
<s> This one , however , was fine . </s>
<s> Elegant , light to medium bodied and with good use of oak . </s>
<s> Good texture to the wine . </s>
<s> Possibly needs more time in bottle to be at its absolute best . </s>
<s> **** I don ' t know whether to score this wine or not . </s>
<s> When first opened there was an immediate whiff of corkiness . </s>
<s> However , returning to the wine later in the evening no corkiness was present , but it did seem a bit flabby and with an oxidised edge . </s>
<s> I am now drinking the rest of the bottle as I type . </s>
<s> Again , when I first took the cork out ( a different cork to keep it stoppered up over night ) a corky edge lurked within the wine . </s>
<s> But it disappeared ! </s>
<s> As had the oxidised edge ! </s>
<s> The wine I am drinking now is a delight of steely mature chardonnay . </s>
<s> Wine left overnight like this usually leaves me cold ( see the note for Pichon ' 92 below ). </s>
<s> But this wine seems to be living in reverse ( if I left it another few days I ' d probably end up with a bunch of grapes ). </s>
<s> Quite a lot of crystals are present in the wine ( they actually made a noise on the bottom of the glass when I poured the last glass from the bottle ). </s>
<s> Scored as it is now drinking : top *** Beginning to tire - fruit oxidising . </s>
<s> Drinkable , but not for too much longer . </s>
<s> *** A joy . </s>
<s> Not a wine that needs too much thinking about , but delivers what is expected of a decent twenty - year - old Pauillac . </s>
<s> Elegance and grace , and with the clarety minerality of age . </s>
<s> At peak , I think , but no rush to drink up . </s>
<s> **** I have quite a lot of this wine , and I have been a bit concerned of more recent times whether I needed to rush to drink it up . </s>
<s> On this bottle ' s showing , I need not have too many worries about that . </s>
<s> Not quite up to the standard of the previous wine ( it somehow lacks the breeding ), but good nonetheless with fruit and maturity working well together . </s>
<s> No rush to drink up . </s>
<s> **** A bottle opened the night before which LJM brought round on the off chance . </s>
<s> Alas , not really fair to judge this wine in such condition . </s>
<s> So I won ' t score . </s>
<s> Not Rated From a half . </s>
<s> Dark tarry , amber colour . </s>
<s> Lovely black treacle nose . </s>

<s> Authentic Burgundy fruit , decent acidity and a sophisticated creaminess to the texture - all very good . </s>
<s> It seemed to lack a measure of intensity , particularly late on the palate - it seems to fail to be either properly intellectual or properly hedonistic . </s>

<s> **** </s>
<s> Light fragile colour , sweet dilutish strawberry colour . </s>
<s> Pleasant enough . </s>
<s> ** Well put together tight wine , bright and vibrant . </s>
<s> Good fruit , nice balance . </s>
<s> Probably only for short term aging . </s>
<s> A good **(*) </s>
<s> White bread leaps about of the bottle on opening . </s>
<s> Nutty , dry , green apples - the fruit changes every time you come back to it . </s>
<s> A prestige cuvee that lives up the billing . </s>
<s> Lovely drinking . </s>
<s> Easy **** Could do with another year or so to mellow , but this is nicely structured fizz with floral aromas and refined , appley pinot fruit ( it ' s a BdN , I believe ) with overtones of white chocolate . </s>
<s> Pleasingly dry . </s>
<s> Top *** A blend of grapes from 89 , 90 and 91 - Cuvee 5 , disgorged March 04 . </s>
<s> Fresh bread and apple nose , rich full yeasty and meaty palate . </s>
<s> Perhaps in danger of being a bit coarse without food ( as Blanc de Noirs sometimes are ) - possibly a little more time in bottle will help . </s>
<s> Complex and with a long , honied finish . </s>
<s> This opens up with a little breathing and is really rather good . </s>
<s> Top **** Honey , yeast , apples - a complex nose and palate that repays attention . </s>
<s> This still seems a bit tightly wound as yet . </s>
<s> My impression is that while very good there ' s no extra depth of character apparent from its " single vineyard " status . </s>
<s> A prestige cuvee I ' ll try again but I won ' t be rushing . </s>
<s> Bare **** Unpleasantly oxidised . </s>
<s> I hope this is an odd bottle . </s>
<s> Not Rated A half , opened rather soon after shipping . </s>
<s> Seemed confected and estery at first , quite citric but with decent concentration . </s>
<s> I think this is better than it initially seems . </s>
<s> Let ' s say it is scraping *** White bread and currants on the nose . </s>
<s> Light to medium weight - elegant fruit . </s>
<s> Quite a lot of Meunier - which shows slightly negatively on the palate . </s>
<s> Very good but could one ask for slightly more intensity without sacrificing the elegance ? </s>
<s> I ' m not sure . </s>
<s> I ' m being critical - but this is very nice . </s>
<s> ( 2001 plus reserve wines - disgorged June 2004 - I like the informative back - label ). </s>
<s> Very top *** Rich nose - chocolate , yeast , dense fruit . </s>
<s> Quite a weighty , vinous palate - perhaps a bit heavy at the moment and perhaps rather wood - influenced , but this might mellow with a year or two in bottle into something very fine . </s>
<s> Might even rate another star in its way but for now *** Touch of white bread but mainly ripe Granny Smith apples on the nose . </s>
<s> Pretty decent basic NV . </s>
<s> Bare *** Perfectly pleasant but a bit nondescript . </s>
<s> This has aged OK without really developing in an interesting way . </s>
<s> *** This is rather dominated by farmyard straw on the nose an palate - too rustic for me in a way that I don ' t think will improve with age . </s>
<s> OK , but no more than that . </s>
<s> Bare *** 100 % old - vine Pinot Meunier and thus interesting . </s>
<s> Floral and perhaps floury ( or am I being influenced by the name of the grape ) fruit , quite forward in the mouth and a bit colourless on the mid - palate with an ordinary finish . </s>
<s> Real Champagne balance ( quite dry ) makes it pretty drinkable however , although it is hard to find much real complexity . </s>
<s> An oddity that is worth trying , particularly if one wants to get a grip on the grape and what it might contribute to wines like Moet NV , for instance . </s>
<s> Scrapes *** Quite autolytic , appley fruit , complex an honied , quite dry and with good pinot gutsiness . </s>
<s> All this after seeming a bit maderised at first , but as often with Champagne this seemed to blow off . </s>
<s> Excellent . </s>
<s> **** Citric , appley nose with yeasty notes - quite complex . </s>
<s> Ripe , rounded fruit despite the excellent acidity of the vintage - needs a bit more time though - aspects of it seem quite tightly wound still . </s>
<s> Quite long too and creamy textured . </s>
<s> ****(*) Light to medium weight , elegant , complex and nutty , quite long . </s>
<s> Just occasionally it seems a little oily / keroseney on the palate but that may be the food I am having with it . </s>
<s> Really pretty good , although probably for drinking over the next couple of years . </s>
<s> A good deal from Oddbins at not muchover Ł20 . </s>
<s> Bare **** A bit coarse on first sip , but this seems less noticable afterwards . </s>
<s> The fruit quality is a way short of Champagne so a fairly basic wine . </s>
<s> Pleasnat enough . </s>
<s> * One of those evenings with a lot of corked and oxidised bottles - even before I arrived there had been some bad whites ! </s>
<s> Last taste from a nearly exhhuasted bottle ( I arrived late ). </s>
<s> Seemed typically lovely . </s>
<s> **** Gamy , succulent tannins . </s>
<s> Lovely . </s>
<s> **** Slightly corky . </s>
<s> Not Rated Completely shot - oxidised . </s>

<s> Really , really top Port . </s>
<s> ****** Complete wine - really pretty good but so upstaged by the Niepoort . </s>
<s> Bare ***(*) Mainly from my own cellar , tasted in the last month or two Quite mineral , but this seems a bit flabbier , flatter and lacking freshness than I remember . </s>
<s> I could worry that we have a touch of premature - oxidation disease here although the wine is perfectly drinkable . </s>
<s> I hope it ' s an odd bottle , the one I had in July 2004 was fine and I ' ve had a couple since which I did not note because they were similar . </s>
<s> ** Nice fruit , very drinkable . </s>
<s> Quite luscious even with a richness that one might attribute to the standing of the vineyard . </s>
<s> Good balance too . </s>
<s> But nice though it is , I find it rather undemanding - no tautness , no succulence , in short no really grown - up qualities . </s>
<s> I ' d hope for more excitment from this vineyard . </s>
<s> Still a fine drink , and it doesn ' t sell for huge money either . </s>
<s> *** A bottle drunk over two evenings as opposed to my last notr from the middle of a wine dinner . </s>
<s> Bright and attractive raspberry , cranberry and beetroot Pinot - a touch of oak and tannins but fundamentally in an easy drinking style . </s>
<s> Very pleasant drinking but not profound . </s>
<s> Will improve a touch over a shortish timescale but not a long - term wine . </s>
<s> *** Very ( excessively even ) citric , good acidity and a modest finish . </s>
<s> No sign of 96 oxidation . </s>
<s> I was given this knowing only that it was a 96 white Burgundy - thought it might be a disappointing grander wine . </s>
<s> Actually this is rather good for its level . </s>
<s> Top ** On first opening , bright , high - toned , delciously fruity - mainly red fruits - and with good balance and length . </s>
<s> Very quaffable . </s>
<s> Later , some minerality appears too and it seems stylish too . </s>
<s> Very nice indeed . </s>
<s> Probably for drinking over the next few years . </s>
<s> A very top *** Even with decanting , still quite hard and needing food . </s>
<s> Stylish - I hope it will resolve well . </s>
<s> *** A bit reductive at first , opens out to reveal strong high - toned fruit and a bit of pinot animality . </s>
<s> A touch hard at the moment , particularly without food , but pretty good . </s>
<s> Top *** Splendidly mineral and delicious . </s>
<s> Bare **** One bottle rather orange an unpalatable - oxidized Burgundy syndrome , I fear . </s>
<s> Another quite mature and hinting at the same but still rather good and pleasantly drinkable . </s>
<s> The good one : ** Fresh strawberry fruit , moderate acidity , some tannins and still quite firm although the acidity is moderate . </s>
<s> Opens out nicely overnight but still has a twist of bitterness at the end of the palate that I have mixed feelings about . </s>
<s> Bare *** Bone - dry , austere at first but then just very classic appetising white Burgundy at peak . </s>
<s> Bare **** The Champagne was the last wine of the dinner , and very good it was too . </s>
<s> Very elegant - specially considering this is blanc de noirs . </s>
<s> Dry yet very appetizing . </s>
<s> Bare ***(*) Quite fine - creamy but a little sweet - lacks minerality and steelyness . </s>
<s> *** Dumb - or not quite right - could even be the early stages of premature oxidation . </s>
<s> Not Rated Tight , dry Meursault nuttyness , lovely acid , touch of lemon . </s>
<s> Very fine . </s>

<s> *** Ravishingly gorgeous , elegant , fragrant fruit . </s>
<s> Very lovely , if a little light and perhaps no more than it ought to be for a Grand Cru . </s>
<s> Some want to keep this for 10 years and ( probably ) good it will be in rather a different way , but I love it now too . </s>
<s> ***** Lovely mushroomy nose , perfectly fresh , nicely dry . </s>

<s> ***** Creamy and mineral . </s>

<s> Friends brought this round for lunch . </s>
<s> Lovely medium weight Burgundy with touches of toffee , nuts and melon . </s>
<s> Good to have a wine that doesn ' t seem sterile in its freshness and isn ' t trying to be any more than it should be . </s>
<s> *** And here ' s the coincidence . </s>
<s> I just happened to drag this out of the racks in preparation for the same lunch . </s>
<s> This , as one would expect , has more signs of age - there ' s also a slight dirtiness / stalkiness to the wine ( again none of that sterility that can make some modern wine so boring ). </s>
<s> Good maturing Burgundy . </s>
<s> *** This wine has been a bit of an enigma over the years - Toby and I have both given varying reports . </s>

<s> It has the structure ( some tannins ) and balance to improve . </s>

<s> ****(*) A little diffuse on the nose by comparison - there ' s some extra complexity from the odd mix of grapes involved , but I feel that is superficial and I prefer the honied purity of the Ribolla . </s>
<s> Excellent again . </s>
<s> **** Honied nectarine again , excellent but lacking the depth of the 1999 - also perhaps a touch " flatter ". </s>
<s> Still exciting . </s>
<s> Bare **** Interesting , fine flavours - again a lot less weighty than the 1999 . </s>

<s> Bare *** Lighter , but with some extra spice . </s>
<s> A bit grippier than the 2000 . </s>
<s> Quite complex and structured - drinking quite nicely . </s>

<s> Provence herbs - bags of character . </s>
<s> ***(*) </s>
<s> Fine , attractive nose but the fruit while initially exciting is marred by a bitter twist towards the finish . </s>
<s> This defect seems less evident a day later - while the wine seems quite mature , I wonder if it might benefit from more time . </s>
<s> Pretty good . </s>
<s> *** Cashews , yeasty bread , honey , creamy fruit - a different character on returning each time . </s>
<s> Taught acidity and good length . </s>
<s> Really fine - perhaps even ****(*) Brioche and honey nose , quite citric ( lemon and grapefruit ) palate . </s>
<s> A little disjointed still but time will draw it together nicely . </s>
<s> Softly frothy now , as one might expect from its youth . </s>
<s> Very good . </s>
<s> ***(*) Most of my recent notes of this wine have been from a single case bought at auction a while ago . </s>
<s> I have since discovered from the nice people at Gosset that it is a 93 + 94 + 95 blend . </s>
<s> Lovely honey and apples with yeasty undertones . </s>
<s> Some will say it is showing a touch of oxidative character and I suppose it is although I don ' t find it remotely a problem . </s>
<s> Very rich but now in perfect balance . </s>
<s> **** Quitelarge - framed , a bit coarse and difficult towards the finish - perhaps a year in bottle would help . </s>
<s> Ok , but I ' m not wild about this . </s>
<s> From a half . </s>
<s> Bare *** Doughy but floral nose , quite tight , dry and precise , elegant palate - decent length but with a touch of hardness that needs a year or two . </s>

<s> Bare ***(*) Lost in my filing system - this is from dinner at a BYO restaurant a few months ago , but I can ' t recall when . </s>
<s> Mainstream Chassagne . </s>

<s> Picquant and medicinal . </s>
<s> Attractive as a lunchtime port ! </s>
<s> A good *** Elegant , lightweight , fresh and bright . </s>
<s> Rather nice . </s>
<s> Top *** Very pale - the colour has dropped out as sediment . </s>
<s> Madeira - like nose , pleasant port palate . </s>
<s> ** Quite pale , rather eveloved ( the level is bottom - shoulder which might be the reason ). </s>
<s> Rather savoury and delicious but not quite what it ought to be , I feel . </s>
<s> Top *** Very pale , mushrooms and biscuits . </s>
<s> Probably very old ( some paper labels claim some of these bottles as 1850 ' s - if any are , it ' s this one ) and past its best . </s>
<s> ** From different source and showing up all the previous wines . </s>
<s> Lovely graceful old wine , fruity and scented , still fresh . </s>
<s> It develops in the glass and is completely delicious . </s>
<s> Top ***** Nutty , yeasty , lovely mature Champagne . </s>
<s> Bare ***** Quite forward , slightly fat 98 style . </s>
<s> Completely healthy but for drinking . </s>

<s> A stunning effort for the vintage . </s>
<s> Top **** Still a touch hard but very fine . </s>

<s> Rather good . </s>
<s> Top *** Very rancio , cloudy ( and still so the next day ). </s>
<s> Rich and thick and with something of Ozzie liquor Muscat about it . </s>
<s> Curious . </s>
<s> Top *** </s>
<s> Yeasty , very nice - Champagne quality although different in character . </s>
<s> *** Tight , lovely , classic white Burgundy ***(*) Rather evolved - creamy marzipan . </s>
<s> Very good but might have been better a few years ago . </s>

<s> Might well improve further . </s>
<s> Very nice . </s>
<s> Makes an interesting comparison with the Roda : I prefer this because its much less international . </s>

<s> Rather international , but good of its sort . </s>
<s> *** Very classic , dry , tannic , high - toned . </s>
<s> Top *** Rich fruit . </s>

<s> Bare **** Very marmaladey , soft , delicious . </s>
<s> I need to think more about this - is it Tokay somehow as it should be , or is it turned into something else for the modern market . </s>
<s> I ' m not sure yet , and I need to drink a couple of glasses more contemplatively . </s>
<s> Still , it ' s at least very impressive . </s>
<s> **** </s>
<s> Nicely shaped bottle , and reasobale stuff inside it . </s>
<s> A bit coarse and woody , and a bit too sweet . </s>
<s> **(*) I think I ' ve had this for a few years . </s>

<s> Lovely honeyed and mineral palate . </s>
<s> A joy . </s>
<s> Just goes to show that you shouldn ' t rush drinking Champagne ! </s>
<s> Top *** OK , but nothing out of the ordinary . </s>
<s> ** I haven ' t had Koonunga Hill for ages . </s>
<s> I was pleasantly surprised . </s>
<s> Very Penfolds in style ( no bad thing to my mind ) - velvety smooth , not trying to be too big , gentle on the head . </s>
<s> *** Good nose , but not typical . </s>
<s> A really very coarse palate . </s>
<s> * </s>
<s> Rather fine fruit with just a touch of lychee - not very varietal now , more mineral - some will say too old but I think its at a peak . </s>
<s> Pleasingly dry too - quite a fine wine . </s>
<s> Is this just age or is this old - style Zind before the days of extra residual sugar ? </s>
<s> Whatever , it ' s rather nice . </s>
<s> Top *** Tarry , fragrant , everything you could want from a typical , good Barolo in a decent but not special vintage . </s>
<s> Needs drinking in the next few years . </s>
<s> Top *** Rather deliciously smooth and fragrantly , softly Volnay . </s>
<s> I noted after a while that this had been tarted up with quite a lot of new oak . </s>
<s> Very good of its kind , and quite good even in absolute terms . </s>
<s> *** Lovely old - wine nose , fresh fruit . </s>
<s> Coarsened after 30 minutes or so and faded a bit . </s>
<s> Still rather pleasant . </s>
<s> No indication on this half as to whether this was a Riserva or anything . </s>
<s> Bare *** Nicely made , fruity but not vulgar . </s>
<s> Very drinkable . </s>
<s> Bare ** No excessive 2003 flab although I ' d like a bit more precision and minerality . </s>
<s> Decent wine . </s>
<s> ** Excellent fruit , especially given the vintage . </s>
<s> Gamy and mineral . </s>
<s> A lovely mouthful but the finish is a touch harsh . </s>
<s> Still **** Nice weight , attractive fruit but it seemed a bit flabby - maybe just a touch warm . </s>
<s> *** </s>
<s> Creamy , fragrant , delicate , quite fine . </s>
<s> Butterscotch background to greengage fruit . </s>
<s> Completely fresh with a long finish . </s>
<s> ( Magnum ) ***** Excellent - tropical - edged very lemony fruit . </s>
<s> Some oak I think . </s>
<s> Nice balance and very rich . </s>
<s> Big - a bit modern but very good . </s>
<s> Aiming at the Beaucastel Rousanne VV style perhaps . </s>
<s> *** Very fizzy to the extent of being a fault . </s>
<s> But it wears off enough to form a judgement - quite mineral and characterful . </s>
<s> Serious wine that I ' d like to try again . </s>
<s> At least a good *** Lovely , creamy , fine acidity , good length . </s>
<s> Appetizing . </s>
<s> Lovely . </s>
<s> **** A touch closed and struck matches too . </s>
<s> Opens out - great concentration . </s>
<s> A top ***(*) Nice rich fruit , dry long . </s>
<s> top *** Still red Pinot Noir from Champagne . </s>
<s> So soft and silky . </s>
<s> Gorgeously round . </s>
<s> Easy - going . </s>
<s> One of the best non - Burgundian Pinots I have tasted . </s>
<s> Top *** Beetroot fruit - harder than the previous wines . </s>
<s> Very baked and extracted . </s>
<s> This is really not a success . </s>
<s> ** Lots of grippy tannins . </s>
<s> Highly - wrought and oaky . </s>
<s> Not my sort of thing - but striking . </s>
<s> Certainly needs time but what will happen ? </s>
<s> *** Very fine - deep , rich , silky with a lovely refined , dry palate . </s>
<s> Splendid for vintage , but could one regret the lack of C - R typicity ? </s>
<s> ***** Rich pineapple , nice acid . </s>
<s> Very pleasant . </s>
<s> Bare *** Lighter at the final analysis - although more mouthfilling . </s>
<s> Top ** Bright , both metaphorically and literally . </s>
<s> A touch hard on the finish still although coming round to drinking . </s>
<s> A touch short of the richness you might hope for from Grahams in this vintage . </s>
<s> Still worth ***(*) </s>
<s> Acacia , nuts . </s>
<s> Intense , dry , long . </s>
<s> Drinking but no hurry . </s>
<s> **** Lime , herbs , cream . </s>
<s> Not heavy on the palate - lovely . </s>
<s> Top **** Big and muscular - grand cru intensity and rich finish . </s>
<s> Very good . </s>
<s> ***(*) Fragrant , piquant cranberry , yet meaty ( bovril ) nose . </s>
<s> Excellent for the vintage . </s>
<s> Partly on the basis of interest - a bare **** Promoted conversation - apart from anything else putting a wax seal on an Australian wine is making a statement . </s>
<s> A touch mineral , quite complex fruit - pure too and not overstated . </s>
<s> Personally , I still find an overlying minty sweetness in the finish not to my taste although that might be less noticable with the right food . </s>
<s> Interesting wine that somebody with more of a taste for Australian style might rate a bit more . </s>
<s> Still *** Fat , nice botrytis , a touch of paint - stripper and not so long . </s>
<s> Good ** Less intense , less flawed and follows through a bit better to the finish . </s>
<s> Nice . </s>
<s> *** Lightweight yet concentrated . </s>
<s> Ethereal , complex chocolatey fruit . </s>
<s> Lovely . </s>
<s> ***** These three wines were very kindly sent by the winery who had noticed that FWD isn ' t always very kind to Beaujolais . </s>
<s> I tasted these with LJM ( sometime contributor to FWD ). </s>
<s> I ' m afraid that these three wines still failed to convince me completely about Beaujolais . </s>
<s> But they have persuaded me that I need to try a few more . </s>
<s> Earthy , fresh fruity zingy nose with a hint of vanilla - good texture on the palate . </s>
<s> My favourite of the three wines for drinking now . </s>
<s> *** I ' m afraid I couldn ' t really get on with this wine - it seemed light and dilute and was a touch green at the end . </s>
<s> Possibly a faulty bottle so I won ' t score Not Rated Quite a soft wine - maturity taking over from the earlier gamay vibrancy I guess . </s>
<s> Initially a bit dumb and subdued , but after time the wine opened out . </s>
<s> It would be interesting to try this in another couple of years to see whether it is just at a bit of an inbetween phase . </s>
<s> For now *** </s>
<s> Excellent condition at 10 years old , very good fruit too , although for some reason I could not get that excited about it . </s>
<s> Still a decent *** My last bottle of this - and hasn ' t it kept well . </s>
<s> Completely fresh but fully mature , quite soft and very pleasingly drinkable . </s>
<s> *** Very juicy with a touch of Italianate bitterness to give it a grown - up appeal . </s>
<s> Finishes a touch abruptly perhaps . </s>
<s> A good * A glass at Valvona ' s Vincafe , even so clearly very elegant , refined , blanced and generally yummy . </s>
<s> *** Very classy , loads of fruit , fairly forward , drinking very nicely . </s>
<s> Top *** On opening , quite tough - you have to like tannins for this . </s>
<s> It does have the most fantastic ripe fruit though and 24 hours after opening it had really opened out . </s>
<s> Delicious . </s>
<s> Easy *** This guy is one hell of a winemaker . </s>
<s> This has concentrated tarry raspberry fruit on the nose , bags of tannins ( which are ripe enough to be enjoyable even at this stage ), super concentration and texture and a long finish . </s>
<s> High - toned , despite being a bit more forward than the 96 . </s>
<s> Excellent . </s>
<s> Easily ***(*) Written from memory a day or two later : surprisingly old - fashioned orange - rimmed colour . </s>
<s> Quite forward and easy - going , drinking OK at the moment in fact but surely more time can only improve matters . </s>
<s> Very classy . </s>
<s> *** </s>
<s> Quite dry , fairly austere but very good , particularly with some nibbles . </s>
<s> Bare ***(*) More forward and fragrant , not really noticably sweeter . </s>
<s> Good *** This is half Chardonnay and half Pinot Meunier - the latter not that apparent . </s>
<s> Very yeasty , seems a bit four - square at the moment ( perhaps that is where one sees the P - M ). </s>
<s> Rich and really very long . </s>
<s> Clearly need quite a lot of time , and I can see it could well be very good in a decade or so , although it might be a bit light on finesse . </s>
<s> Bare **(**) Curious - very exotic , vanillan , and highly vinous . </s>
<s> Not everyones idea of Champagne , but you can ' t say it lacks character . </s>
<s> I need to drink this over an evening ( with food ) and see how my relationship with it develops . </s>
<s> For now a top *** Dry , real Puligny , quite intense . </s>
<s> Not special but it does what it says on the tin . </s>
<s> *** Quite rich , mouthfilling wine . </s>
<s> Lacks the classic finesse that marks out the stars . </s>
<s> Top *** Nice fruit - pure , intense . </s>
<s> *** A bit more oaky - but quality fruit again . </s>
<s> *** Seepage round the cork ( under the capsule ). </s>
<s> Odd but not undrinkable - clearly faulty . </s>
<s> Not Rated Depths , depths and more depths . </s>
<s> Really lovely , both rich and piquant . </s>
<s> Very top ***(*) Burnt , dense , exotic , meaty . </s>
<s> Tannic . </s>
<s> Austere , difficult . </s>
<s> This might yet come good , and even now it is arresting and interesting drinking . </s>
<s> Risky to rely on it evolving well , but if all goes well ***(*) Attractive green rim - never a bad sign . </s>
<s> On the palate , like a really fine old Madeira in every way except there is not the real intensity or searing acidity on the palate . </s>
<s> The flavours however are very fine and this is a lovely drink . </s>
<s> Top *** Chocolatey fruit - very nice old Colheita . </s>
<s> Top *** </s>
<s> Possibly a touch too old now , but lovely old Champagne nonetheless . </s>
<s> Mature and elegant for its depth . </s>
<s> **** One of the first wines I bought with a view to keeping . </s>
<s> I love old white Burgundy , and this didn ' t let me down . </s>
<s> Lovely , oily , nutty ethereal stuff . </s>
<s> **** Disappointing . </s>
<s> Not past it , but just not particularly special . </s>
<s> Maybe it still needs loads more time to develop ? </s>
<s> ** Lovely pure beetroot and raspberry nose . </s>
<s> Drinking very well . </s>
<s> Silky . </s>
<s> ***** OK , so we drank this thinking it was showing well for the 1978 vintage . </s>
<s> The label wasn ' t in the best condition . </s>
<s> The next morning I was just sorting through the corks when I noticed we had really been drinking the 1982 . </s>
<s> The last time I had this wine I was disappointed , and I was again this time . </s>
<s> It ' s OK , but it hasn ' t got the structure or depth expected . </s>
<s> *** </s>
<s> Stylish nose , slightly resinous - a bit thin on the palate . </s>
<s> Pleasant . </s>
<s> * Slightly flat , flavoursome , a bit rustic . </s>
<s> Interesting , up to a point . </s>

<s> Lovely Burgundy . </s>
<s> Good intensity and structure . </s>
<s> Needs time . </s>
<s> Top ***(*) Mothbally at first . </s>
<s> Disjointed but intense palate . </s>
<s> Emerges - needs time . </s>
<s> Will be great I suspect . </s>
<s> ***(**) Honied nose , strong palate . </s>
<s> Quite evolved - ready in fact and needing drinking over the next few years , I suspect . </s>
<s> Even unflawed 96 ' s seem to be aging quite quickly . </s>
<s> **** Open , peachy , luxurious . </s>
<s> A little light , some thought , but I loved it . </s>
<s> **** Cough - sweet and smoky . </s>
<s> Interesting , but slightly harsh on the finish . </s>
<s> perhaps needs time . </s>
<s> ***(*) Grenachey , cassis overtones - quite raw finish . </s>
<s> A bit rubbery . </s>
<s> ** Caramel nose . </s>
<s> A touch rough , perhaps . </s>
<s> Opens out - quite classically chateauneuf . </s>
<s> Top *** Nice balance , clearly warm - vintage . </s>
<s> A lovely balance of slavours . </s>

<s> A good **** Yummy drinkability . </s>
<s> Stands up in this company - if a bit simple . </s>

<s> Bare *** Burnt , a bit thin . </s>
<s> Bare ** Fragrant fruit , a touch hard , a touch of aniseed . </s>
<s> fairly lightweight . </s>
<s> Top *** </s>
<s> My memory of vintages of this Provence wine from some years ago is of the fruit being a bit sweet - this though seems rather good : Provencal herbs over cassis fruit with a lot of smoky cigar box . </s>
<s> Very much a point and it has kept well . </s>
<s> A little simple perhaps but I believe this was not a particularly good vintage for the property . </s>
<s> Good effort - I ' d like to try some other vintages . </s>
<s> *** Quite concentrated and flavoursome , but lacking finesse for me in a way that I ' m not sure more time will alleviate . </s>
<s> PLeasant then but not fantastic . </s>
<s> *** Smoke and pepper - fruit gently weakening perhaps but very drinkable . </s>
<s> *** Blackberry and apple fruit with interesting sauvage overtones - once open for a few hours , very stylish indeed . </s>
<s> Will probably improve for a year or two . </s>
<s> *** A bit stinky on opening - it blows off to some extent but a touch of something foetid remains . </s>
<s> Still , quite a dense , brown - sugar palate follows with a hint of volatility or something . </s>
<s> Good rather than exceptional . </s>
<s> *** Fruity , grassy - like a new world semillon . </s>
<s> Pleasant enough . </s>
<s> * Nice fruit quality - quite suave . </s>
<s> Decent length . </s>
<s> Top * Very fresh raspberry fruit with a meaty underlay . </s>
<s> Very refined texture and good length . </s>
<s> Once it has been open a while it seems even more Burgundian . </s>
<s> It needs a bit more minerality or something to be truly outstanding . </s>
<s> Scrapes **** Slate , sherbert , a touch sour as MSR wines can be . </s>
<s> Good length , maybe a touch hollow in the middle - something I find occasionally with the vintage . </s>
<s> Fine , but not exceptional by the high standards of the domain . </s>
<s> Top *** Quite tight and closed , but opens out with time as it warms up . </s>
<s> Excellent intensity and a long brioche finish . </s>
<s> Good balance . </s>
<s> ****(*) Very thin and dull . </s>
<s> Drinkable but No Stars </s>
<s> Modern - styled , but very nicely done . </s>
<s> Limey acidity . </s>
<s> Satisfying , but completely upstaged by the Jobard that follows . </s>
<s> *** More reserved , but much more complexity and " beyond - fruit " flavours . </s>
<s> Excellent . </s>
<s> ***(*) Dry , reserved , quite persistent . </s>
<s> Rather good . </s>
<s> Bare ***(*) Oxidised - but it did have a slightly loose cork . </s>
<s> Not Rated Softer and rounder than the Lafarge below . </s>
<s> Still quite piquant on the palate . </s>
<s> *** Dry , fragrant , good length . </s>
<s> Fairly austere at first and less flattering than the Jadot wine . </s>
<s> Might till improve touch , while the Jadot is ready . </s>
<s> *** Open 24 hours . </s>
<s> Seems good . </s>
<s> Quite mineral . </s>
<s> *** </s>
<s> Sold to me in Oddbins as the wine that beat Dom Perignon in a recent competition . </s>
<s> Actually it might have been the NV Blin that did this - different assistants in Oddbins attributed the result to both wines . </s>

<s> There ' s a touch of sweetness and some heaviness of hand . </s>
